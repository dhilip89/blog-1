Hello fellow readers,
In this post I’ll list some of the projects
and experiments I worked on or finished since [last
time](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/programming/2016/06/12/june-2016-project.html),
or planing to work on in the next few weeks.


### Intro EP ###

_Language:Psychology_ 

_Explanation_: My marathon project is finally taking shape.

This project aims at people who are interested in evolution and psychology
and who are seeking answers to questions related to universalilty in
human psychology.

It introduces the field of dynamic evolutionary psychology, a mix
of evolutionary psychology and social movements.

However, as a social science, it isn't an exact science.
The field is full of theories but even without being fully accurate the
project is a way to peak into basic human nature and to ask questions
about mundane daily behaviors.

The other goal is to have the explanation as clean, concise, and direct as
possible, without concealing anything and without scientific jargon.
Anyone should be able to understand those theories and claims without having
to go through research papers.

Nevertheless, this is at the cost of sounding wrong in some places.


### Hacking Video Contest and Webcast ###

![hackish2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/hackish2.png)

_Language:1337 mad hacking skills_ 

_Explanation_: [z3bra](http://z3bra.org) from nixers.net
prepared a contest about recording a ["hackish" video on
Unix](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1935).

>
>Hey there!
>
>I know most of you enjoy contests, so I came up with a new idea.
>Last year, we made the "nixers workflow compilation", which everybody enjoyed.
>
>This year, I would like to make a more "funny" one, by having everyone record a fake hacking screencast!
>
>
>Beware, nothing amongst those line: h4x0r.webm. The screencast should last ~1 minute and illustrate what YOU think a hacker's desktop would look like. It would start from an empty desktop, then open a bunch of windows and perform some fake (or real, your choice ;)) action to infiltrate or exploit some random host. Be creative! Don't mimic those bullshit desktop of teenagers hacking the FBI, running "tree" in cmd.exe.

It was entertaining to create a scenario and then building and setting
up the machine to reproduce it.

It was even more fascinating to watch what other members came up with.
This was an authentic experience, never done before with the community,
and consequently everyone was not biased in their artistic view.

You can find the video of the compilation in those formats:

* [OGG](http://pub.z3bra.org/vid/linux/nixers-20160808.ogg)
* [WEBM](http://pub.z3bra.org/vid/linux/nixers-20160808.webm)

I've also started a [webcast
thread](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1924) where people share
what their current workflow.


### Google Maps, The quest continues ###


![gmap]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/gmap1.jpg)

_Language:Epic Quest_ 

_Explanation_: The adventure continues. We explored new areas and mapped
mesmerizing sites.
On the road we had so much fun, getting lost in unusual locations.

We reached local guide level 3 on google maps, [here](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107801532253558144711/photos)'s our profile.
With those contributions we hope to let others know about those phenomenal
and unpopular places of Lebanon.

And I think we've achieved a lot so far.


### Back To old ###


![mario]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mario.png)

_Language:Motor reflexes_ 

_Explanation_: I'm playing
retro-games...[again](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2013/06/17/cheap-gaming.html)
but this time with my significant other, (ღ˘⌣˘ღ) ♫･*:.｡. .｡.:*･  
This is an unexpected way to let stress and anxiety flow out while
having an enjoyable and exciting moment. Moreover it builds up fast
motor reflexes and visual responsiveness.

I'm also back on the guitar, and still badly suck at it... But it's a
fun meditative experience to mix up with my usual routine.
And this is what matters.


### Next Level Ascii ###


![slicer]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ascii/as24.png)

_Language:Amiga's ASCII char set_ 

_Explanation_: My robot army is growing bigger and bigger.  
World domination is a dream that is getting closer.

There are many new pieces to my [ascii artwork
collection](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/ascii.html) and I've also
participated in a [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)
competition called evoke2016 where I scored [4th
place](http://www.pouet.net/party_results.php?which=18&when=2016) in
the ascii art competition.

![congratz venam]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/congratz.jpg)

Here's my submission:

![venam robot army]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ascii/venam_robot_army.png)

The competition was recorded in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjRHnYIQxe4).

I was also featured in the following releases:

* [impure61](http://bbs.ninja/pack/impure61/)
* [impure62](http://bbs.ninja/pack/impure62/)
* [pouet](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=68110)


Ascii art is a puzzle game - It's about inserting the best character at
the most appropriate position.


### 2bwm ###


![2bwm]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2bwm_.png)

_Language:C_

_Explanation_: 2bwm is still an ongoing project.
I want to refresh the source code, review, cleanse, and minimalize it.

What I've done so far is switching the hardcoded
[EWMH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWMH) to the ones available through
the `xcb_ewmh.h` header.


### Books ###


![blank slate]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/blank_slate.jpg)

_Language:English_

_Explanation_: I'm savoring two new books, one about Unix and the other
psychology and evolution.

* The blank slate - Steven Pinker
* The Art of Unix Programming - Eric Steven Raymond


### 4-3XP - Onward ###


![4-3XP]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/4-3XP.png)

_Language:Audio_

_Explanation_: This is an audio experiment I started since my last post, which
consists of me narrating all my relevant blog posts. I recorded most of them.

You'll notice under the post title a hinting `4-3XP` which, when clicked,
will open a soundcloud embedded player and play the audio version of
the post.

This should give accessibility to persons with vision impairment.


### Nixers Podcast ###


![nixers icon]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nixers_icon.png)

_Language:Unix_

_Explanation_: The nixers podcast is where most of my attention is
consumed these days.

Behind every episode there's a deep research I have to do and between
episodes there's a shift of mind that needs to happen.

The research nudges me to actively research about a particular subject,
piercing through the top thin layer.

Most of the subjects I choose are ones I've been meaning to discover and
understand in more depth but didn't have the patience to do so before.

And at the end of every week I have to summarize what I've learned and
give a generic, cohesive, ordered, and understandable overview of it so
that others can also pinpoint the important aspects of the topic.

I'm trying hard to achieve this.
It's true that I'm the administering forums related to Unix but that
doesn't mean I'm the most knowledgeable person.
I want to transmit clear ideas and avoid confusions that the listeners
might have.
Older Unix users might have done a better job at this, or maybe not.
Maybe it's my naivete and how appealing the learning process is in itself
that trigger me to do daring stuffs at the risk of saying completely
absurd things.

> Try not, do or do not, there is no try.

That's my style.  
I like what's concrete; Better fail but ship something than to sit on your
ass mourning about possible failures.

If someone critics or comments than that would mean I've done something
that matters.

You can find all the podcast episodes on the [forums thread](http://podcast.nixers.net/what)
or you can visit the [feed page](http://podcast.nixers.net/feed).


# What's Next #

I need to finish all the projects I currently have, but what's next after that?

I'm craving for a new big programming project.
This time I want to go back to C or C++, and maybe even tackle with assembly.

I want to write new article on psychology.

Many community projects ideas are fermenting in my mind, they'll soon
come of age.

I'm going to add a beatbox section to my blog. I've been practicing but not
polishing my skills. Having a section will help me keep track of my
progress.

The Ascii art section of the blog is missing screenshots so I'll add those too.

Again, if you want something done, no one's gonna do it for you, use
your own hands.

Let's go for a beer together sometime!

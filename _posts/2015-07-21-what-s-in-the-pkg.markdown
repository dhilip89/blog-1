Hello fellow nixers,  
Let's play "what's in the package".


![stick1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stickers/2.jpg)

![stick3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stickers/3.jpg)

![stick4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stickers/4.jpg)

![stick5]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stickers/5.jpg)

![stick6]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stickers/6.jpg)

![stick7]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stickers/7.jpg)

![stick8]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stickers/8.jpg)

It even comes with a bonus sticker from RedBubble.

They are pretty good quality. Glossy and all.
They cost a bit more to ship than I had anticipated but still worth it.


See ya amigos!

Hello people,

Yet again, I came up with another _little_ quote.

Feel free to use it in any context or to give your opinion about it.

<pre>
Linux - You start by installing things
BSD - You start by compiling things
Mac OS X - They install things for you without you noticing
Windows - You start by uninstalling
</pre>


Voila!

Hello fellow Unixer,

I've generated a page that regroups all the current introductions on a single page.
This should remind us that we've been through a lot as a community and that you might have grown up since the time you've registered.

Think about what you've learned from Nixers, think about all the nice individuals you've met.
The internet is big but we've still found people with the same interests!

See you around!

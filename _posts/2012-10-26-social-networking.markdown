 I've been out of social networking for about a year now, after some obvious wrong things that were going on (like Facebook entering the stock market).
This thread is about your opinion on those horrible, so called, _social networks_.

Here's some interesting videos showing how social networks are misleading:

Personally, I feel like social networks make people look stupid, real dumb. I mean, I've been out of this for a year and when looking at those people wasting so much time on those networks; wandering around laughing at some stupid pictures; hoping that they will/are become/ing popular, while in fact they are not.
This is really disgusting to see all those people trying to persuade themselves that this is important.
Last but not least, when you delete you FB account, FB shows you pictures of **friends** that will, supposedly, miss you. DAMN! I see those friends almost everyday!

Anyway, YOU CAN SHOUT IN THIS THREAD AND SAY WHAT YOU REALLY THINK!!!!

PS: I heard from some people that Facebook is becoming a professional network. don't make me laugh IT WILL NEVER BE PROFESSIONAL; even linkedIN is not professional.
Also, it laggs like hell.

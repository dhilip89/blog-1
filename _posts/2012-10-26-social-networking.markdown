Hello fellow readers,
I've away of social networking scene for about a year now, after some obvious wrong things that were going on like Facebook entering the stock market.

This post is a reminder on those horrible, so called, _online social networks_.

Here are some interesting videos showing how social networks are misleading:

I feel like social networks make people look stupid.
I mean, I've been out of this for a year and I always get that weird nausea
when looking at those people wasting so much of their precious time on those 
networks; wandering, laughing at some stupid pictures, and hoping they 
will/are become/ing popular, while in fact they are not.


Social craving is a virus and Facebook is *abusing* it.


This is really disgusting to see all those people trying to persuade themselves
that this is important. That random individuals will care about what they do in
their daily life.

Last but not least, there's that shocking thing that happens when you delete
you account: Facebook shows you pictures of **friends** that will, supposedly, 
miss you.

DAMN! I see those friends almost everyday!


PS: I heard from some people that Facebook is becoming a professional network. don't make me laugh IT WILL NEVER BE PROFESSIONAL; even linkedIN is not professional.  
Also, it laggs like hell. 

See ya!

Update _2016-03-16_: Facebook has grown so badly. It has invaded the internet.
I've talked a bit about its effect in a more recent post. Unfortunately it has
because the gameplay of many recruitement agencies and the plebs are currently
moving their real life issues unto it. So if you write anything online you can
be sued in real life for it!

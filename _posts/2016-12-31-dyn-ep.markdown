Hello fellow readers,  
It is finally up!

### Dynamic Evolutionsy Psychology ###

![scrot_dynep]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/dyn_ep.png)

_Language:Psychology_ 

_Explanation_: My marathon project is finally published.

You can find it at [psychology.wtf](http://psychology.wtf).  

The core of the website is found in the "Data Bank" and "Cycles" sections.

The data bank is a database of easily understandable researches on
evolutionary psychology, all backed up by references. They are miniature
summaries of research papers.

The cycles section is an attempt at finding links between correlations,
to see the big picture of dynamicity in our built-in biases.

> This project aims at people who are interested in evolution and psychology
> and who are seeking answers to questions related to universalilty in
> human psychology.
> 
> It introduces the field of dynamic evolutionary psychology, a mix
> of evolutionary psychology and social movements.
> 
> However, as a social science, it isn't an exact science.
> The field is full of theories but even without being fully accurate the
> project is a way to peak into basic human nature and to ask questions
> about mundane daily behaviors.
> 
> The other goal is to have the explanation as clean, concise, and direct as
> possible, without concealing anything and without scientific jargon.
> Anyone should be able to understand those theories and claims without having
> to go through research papers.
> 
> Nevertheless, this is at the cost of sounding wrong in some places.

### I wrote a book ###

![out loud 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/out_loud/1.png)

_Language: English_ 

_Explanation_: I mentioned at the end of an [earlier
post](https://venam.nixers.net/blog/programming/2016/09/15/september-2016-projects.html)
that I wanted to write more about psychology and philosophy.

There has been a recent event going under the name of
[nanowrimo](http://nanowrimo.org/) which consisted of writing a novel
in a month. I wasn't able to fulfil the goal of fifty thousand words but
I'm satisfied with the product I've got in the end.

It's called "Out Loud", and you can find it [here](https://venam.nixers.net/blog/psychology/2016/11/20/out-loud.html).

It's a small book about deep thinking and monologue exploration.

### Screenshot section ###

_Language: Unix Ricing_ 

_Explanation_:  In the same [earlier
post](https://venam.nixers.net/blog/programming/2016/09/15/september-2016-projects.html)
I also mentioned that I was missing a screenshot section on my blog.

Well, I stayed true to my words:

# Ascii art new release

![abstract]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ascii/as29.png)

_Language: ASCII_ 

_Explanation_:  The ascii art quest continues.  
The latest pack of "impure!ascii" has been released today:  
[http://pc.textmod.es/pack/impure63/](http://pc.textmod.es/pack/impure63/)

I'm newly exploring abstract art using ascii and it's surprisingly cool.

As usual you can find all my work on github and on [this page](https://venam.nixers.net/blog/asciiart.html).

### Podcast & The newsletter ###

![nixers]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nixers_activities.png)

_Language: Unix_ 

_Explanation_: I'm pushing the activities on nixers.net.  
The podcast had 30 episodes in 2016 and I'm planning on continuing in 2017.  

In 2017 I will try to bring more interview-like episodes.

We also started a newsletter at
[nixers.net/newsletter](https://nixers.net/newsletter).  The aim
of the newsletter is to aggregate 10 interesting links every week.

So far so good, I hope I'm bringing some value to everyone.

# 2bwm updates

![2bwm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/venam/2bwm/master/2bWM.png)

_Language: C_ 

_Explanation_: We recently updated many simple details in 2bwm.
The signal handling is more stable, a restart mechanism using signals is
now available, and you can finally change the colors using Xresources,
without recompiling the window manager.

All those are great improvements and they wouldn't have happened without
the help of the people supporting me.

# Patreon Page

On the subject of support, I've setup a Patreon page.

[patreon.com/venam](https://patreon.com/venam)

I've always been looking for a way to receive donations but none were
valid medium for the miniature country of Lebanon.

Patreon with the help of Payoneer makes this possible.

The only drawback is that Payoneer takes a $3 fee per transaction.

Thus, if you ever feel like contributing and can't think of anything else,
or simply feel like it, you can send some cash in my direction.

It'll probably be used to pay for the servers.


# What's Next #


I recently received an email from the past, one year ago.
It was sent from the website [futureme.org](http://futureme.org).

It was a striking rememberance of what I've achieved during the year
and how I've stayed true to myself.

Let's continue on this path and increment on what I've already done.

Thanks for following my blog!

If you want something done, no one's gonna do it for you, use your
own hands.

And let's go for a beer together sometime, or just chill.

Happy new year!

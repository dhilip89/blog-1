I've been meditating lately, trying to fight the parts of me that aren't in
equilibrium.
After starting my full time job my way of life shaped to fit the situation.
Beyond the changes, those inner thoughts kept surfacing telling me to stay
true to myself.

I am far from an hypocrite, but society brainwash system is strong and if you
find yourself in a weak corner it'll strike hard.

In this article I'll refresh the essence of my being.


##I stand for


`Life is enjoyable and simple.`


The motto of my whole life is simplicity. Consequently, I adhere well with the
minimalist and stoicism philosophies.


####Minimalism


The minimalist way of life states that by letting go of anything that doesn't have a real
purpose or that lost its purpose, the individual frees himself from unneeded
burdens.
The sense of freedom comes from the liberation of a huge wagon of things
that society makes you think you *need*. If you are minimalist you can take a
bare minimum and try new experiences anywhere in the world at any time.
It liberates you from today's tempting capitalist world.
Consequently, minimalists are usually very calm and don't feel pressured.

Minimalism values experiences and knowledge instead of materials, and
relationships. It repels the _gatherer_ in oneself.

A good start for anyone who wants to switch to a minimalist lifestyle is the
90 day rules.

Consider anything around you, if you didn't need it the last 90 days and can't
see yourself needing it in the next 90 days then, following the rule, you can throw
it away.
90 days can be shorten as you get to be less needy. Read more about it [here](http://www.theminimalists.com/ninety/)


One of the reason I am vegetarian is minimalism. Human beings living
in today's environment don't need meat. If I was living in the South pole or
in any harsh land, I'll certainly have to hunt wild animals to feed myself.
However, we fell into abundance and instant gratification.


As a minimalist, I noticed that I am less satisfied by instant gratification
and tend to prefer long term ones.
The reason might be that most instant gratifications are related to
materialistic instincts and long term ones to better being as an individual.


####Stoicism


Stoicism philosophy, blatantly explained, rotates around the thought that
correctly understanding the world minimizes negative emotions.

> I am formed by nature for my own good: I am not formed for my own evil.

Once you have an overview of how everything falls in place it becomes
clear that there isn't anything *bad*. I don't believe in a binomial
categorization, I'm opposed to it. The world isn't salt and
sugar, it's a whole panoply of savors which cannot be said to be *good* or
*bad*. Binomial categorizations are all subjectives.


What could strike you when you become stoic:

* You'll try to maximize your positive emotions by doing things you know make you happy
* You'll accept what cannot be changed
* From time to time you'll get yourself into harsh situations to better understand why other people think the way they do
* You'll have more control over yourself and your life
* You'll understand that if you are unhappy, it is your fault
* You'll have nothing you are not prepared to lose
* You'll live simply because you'll know that everything is temporary
* You'll resist materialism
* You'll refuse to consider yourself a victim
* You'll live in accordance with human nature (because it cannot be changed)
* You'll understand that we are social beings with a social duty


Those go along really well with minimalism.

NB: I used to laugh about it and call it the IDGAF (I don't give a fuck) mentality
but stoicism is more than that.


####Guidance


My interests in sociology and evolution guided me in becoming a
stoic person and my interest in Unix and programming helped me through my
minimalist journey.


I stand for a lot of other things like privacy, environmentalism, and freedom
but I won't mention them in this article.


##The vices of society

####Work & Time


I started a full time job around 5 months ago and it drastically changed my
days. When I was in university I had
plenty of free time that I filled with cool programming projects.
Computing is my hobby, I find it fun, it's my job, and I'm very well paid for it!


The drawback is that to get there I have to take a daily commute that average
to at least 4 hours.
I wake up at 5:45am, leave at 6am, and get back home between 8:15pm and 9pm
depending on how lucky I was.
All and all, when I get home I also have to cook and clean.


This reduced the time that I have for myself. It was pretty harsh
in the beginning, I felt like I was throwing away a huge part of my day.


I had to reconsider how I managed my schedule otherwise I would have lost what
brought me where I am (my sanity Ψ(｀▽´)Ψ).


Thus, I implemented a strict schedule. I made it up by inserting activities
from multiple categories, introducing some I had left behind or wanted to do.
Surprisingly it didn't turn out to be monotonic. A schedule doesn't
necessarily mean a routine.


As far as the commute is concerned, it's now dedicated to reading, watching hacking/security conferences, and listening to music.


I am now pleased with my time management, it has brought me new perspectives.


####Others



![the stranger]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/camus.jpg)



`Everyday is an adventure`, and it has become a truth since I started working.

I've experienced so many strange things.

From the days where I was down to days where I was up, days where I wanted to
kill everyone, days where I wanted to marry everyone. The world is a vast place.


My feelings for humanity have been shattered and reconstructed over and over again.
When you get used to life in a castle you forget what's the value of your meal.
I can't take all the different kinds of people out of my mind now.


My stoic self has learned a lot these last few month.


> You'll live in accordance with human nature

> You'll understand that we are social beings with a social duty


I started enjoying small talks with strangers, the unexpected events that happen
on my daily trips, and the life lessons I get from strangers.


As social beings we should help each others and it hits me deep when I see people
acting contrarily to this even though I can still understand why they act the way they do.
Thanks to all the fabulous strangers I shared precious minutes with, I've learned so much.


####The Fine line


When time runs low you get to feel like you shouldn't waste the free time you've got.

I've realized that a new attitude is building up in me.
It's similar to the God of the old testament, or you gain my love or you'll suffer my wrath.
I feel ten folds more irritated when there's something I don't like and ten folds
happier in the other case.


The food has never tasted better...it has so much flavors! My hangouts with friends have never been funnier!
However, I got nerve recked at smaller stuffs and it builds up bit by bit.
I release the flow by doing sport when I get home and by running at 6am for one hour on my days off.

The same is happening with relationships, I ain't got time for new friendships.
If I have the chance to do something I'll do it with my long time friends.

For the new ones, I've got no time to play around or you stick or you leave me alone.


It incorporated in me a kind of "don't wait anymore" mentality.
I want to maximize enjoyable activities and new knowledge while minimizing material
irritations. I'm already investing in too many long term activities.


I also became totally inhibited of others' opinions.


Overall, I'm a bit more harsh and less likely to let things pass but if you're
inside my circle you get to gain everything from me. Until now, I quite like what outputs
it's giving. No one *fucks around* with me anymore.


####Risks


I try to go on my quest for discoveries, thrills, and risks.
Risks but not dangers. Those kind of activities give some excitement in my life
and they fit well with my non-materialistic Views.
I still mitigate them a bit and do them occasionally because they're way too
gratifying.


Let's name some reasons why I love it:

* The unknown factor

> Sometimes an individual may conduct an experiment in an unknown field that society may have deemed impossible or unachievable and labeled as a 'high-risk activity' due to unknown or unforeseeable outcomes. A good example is the Wright brothers who are credited with making the first controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight.

The unknown frightens the poor souls it shakes them up. To become stronger you have to be used to deal with the unusual, you need to expect the unexpected.
It's a preparation for new events.

* The thrill of discovery

Men are hunters that are hungry.
They chase things and find ingenuous ways to reach their goals.
Most of the time it's by taking risks that we get to them.
Opportunities don't show themselves twice at the same place and the thrill of
having to chase it when it shows up is extremely addictive.

* Self affirmation

Being able to control yourself in situations that you aren't used to is an
amazing skill.
To be the master of your own body, to know that you can go over the limits.
It gives confidence and strengthen you on a social standpoint.
Gaining that, your posture will instantly affirms itself in front of others.


What differentiate a leader from the pack is the ability to take risky but
decisive actions and the ability to keep a culture alive.


####Consumer Market



![the stranger]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/consumer_trap.jpg)



Let's start this paragraph with a quote:


> What my hypothesis leads to is that there are two behavioral types: consumer-driven and producer-led.
> Doing things that are consumer-driven are typically hedonist and thrill-seeking, whereas doing things that are producer-led are typically laborious or profit-seeking.
> The latter appears to be much healthier for my brain and my frame. I have lowered rewards across the board, and instead of living the thrill-depression roller coaster, I am "contented" 24/7. Happiness is a consumer product, contentedness is a masculine goal trait.


Society pressures and tempts you into spending into temporary rewards.
The last few month I've felt it deeply.


Being brainwashed everyday by publicities I've been lead to crave for owning my
own car.
I suddenly felt burdened by materialistic things but then I asked myself
"do I really need one at this exact moment, can't I wait".

The answer is that I can already go wherever I want and when I want. Consequently,
I can wait until my financial situation is more stable to buy any means of
transportation I'll want.


In fact, it becomes evident how hard it is to fight society once you get the
monetary power to buy the things you see. It instantly tries to turn you into
a slave of consumerism. It confuses you to the point where you really _want_ a
master to tell you about all the unnecessary objects you need to buy.


It makes you think that if you are missing those things you are lower, that you
can't elevate yourself. Acquisition isn't the way to go! Collectors are not sane individuals.
Capitalism makes you want to show off to others by being a collector, it gives you
a false sense of affirmation.


Become your own master!


To mentally liberate yourself you need to keep saying: "Do I really need that thing".
Or you can refer to the 90 days rule I mentioned earlier.


When you are finally about to choose the things you need, the things you are
going to really invest in, now it's time to upgrade your life.
Not by wasting everything on temporary temptations, even if they might be cheaper.


When it's time to live the good life it's time to live the good life.

Spend wisely!


####A note on instant gratification


This paragraph is going to be two quotes.


> He started lifting weights, to dress well and approach women.

> He started concentrating on his career, personal goals, and has learned how to say no to people that get on his nerves.

> The truth is:

> He should have always been in shape

> He should have cared about his appearance

> Our generation feel they should be rewarded for just for tidying their room or leaving the house, turning off the video games or going for a walk...

>  When I see men married in these days and ages, I see them "Eating the bread of shame", they are just taller, fatter versions of themselves with all the supposed luxury and privileges of a settled life.

> They have no rites of passage, no trial by ordeal, no cause greater than themselves and professionally sit at places earning pensions that look increasingly like it won't matter by the time they will come to claim it.

> We were warriors by birth, years of brutal exertion, bravery and commitment was the price of feeling entitled to old age in front of the fire and getting fat. Now we are a generation of spiritually and physically fat and old men at age 20 wondering what this nagging feeling at the back of our collective heads is.

> You haven't done anything. We haven't done anything. Short of military service or a committed effort to travelling what could you tell your grandchildren that they'd care for? What have you done to deserve being a family elder, someone to listen to, what have you seen or done that was in anyway remarkable?

> I ask myself this as much and find myself lacking.

> What will I tell my grandchildren?

> What will you tell your grandchildren - what will you have done?



>"We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off."

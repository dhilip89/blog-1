I really like Yopmail; it's free and public.
When I say public, I mean that it doesn't even require a password for you to login into an account.
"Seems fishy", you might say.


Yopmail is useful because it's a garbage, fast creation email.
You can easily make a little bot that uses yopmail to retrieve emails after signing up on a website.
Or, you can also have fun looking at other people's junk while taking a huge shit in the bathroom.


Toilet reading is always entertaining.

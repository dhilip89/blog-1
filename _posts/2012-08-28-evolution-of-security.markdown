Hello blog followers,


I have been watching a lot of video conferences on security and I'm
wondering what will happen in the next years.


Do you think security is like an organism and will adapt itself to threats?   
Instead of surface defenses like IDS, firewall, ID protection, AVs, etc. 
It's evident those methods are not durable solutions, they are patches.

Moreover, do you think security should move it's focus to _irreplaceable
data protection_? To care about things that aren't redoable or would never be
the same, or never taken back.
Namely, IP, personal information, source codes, researches, etc. And to name
a few replaceable things: credit cards, accounts, websites, etc..

Are developers and engineers finally going to design technologies with security
notions in mind or will it always be pushed on someone else's shoulder; to
link the bridge between them. No hardware can be secure if it is not made this
way. Many stories are told about pieces of hardware, such as microwaves or
bread-machines, and even sophisticated - and costly - machineries
that can easily be hacked. (see references)

Is it possible to imagine a future where everything is controlled by technology
but none of it is created in a secure manner.

The data is another issue. It's getting harder and harder to keep information
secret, or at least keep it for a long period.

Passwords aren't considered proof of identify anymore. They are characters that
can be cracked, they have a pattern.
RSA keys are viable alternative to passwords; the two way encryption and public
and private keys mechanism.

The average person is not aware of how easy it is to crack/brute a password.
What will be the way of proving that an account belongs to someone in the future?

What do you think readers, will the world really change that much in the next 3-5 years?

Update: Interesting comments have been posted since the article has been written.

Update _2016-03-16_:  

My prediction about self-morphing IDS or antivirus is coming true.

DARPA is working on something called [cyber grand challenge](http://www.cybergrandchallenge.com/) which is an AI so powerful it can patch program on the fly against flaws and also discover them.

The internet of things has taken place and is growing, security is now a must.  
The object of the *real world* I talked about in 2012 are now everywhere, the
self-driving car are at the door. It's dangerous to not be aware of
basic security practices when building all those new interconnected devices!

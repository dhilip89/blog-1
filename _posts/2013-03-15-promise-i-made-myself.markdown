Hello readers,

This thread is about me whining about spams I receive.

As you might already know I'm a little racist with *wannabe Indian h4x0rs* .

I recently started to receive some spams on my UH emails so I got mad and added them to the junk folder.

Then d9u/zygotb remended that I shouldn't post my email directly in clear text on the internet. He proposed that I should obfuscate the email in a way similar to this:

`patrick [at] nixers [dot] net` 

Or any other way that is still understandable by the reader.

This is a good way to diminish the spams but it wasn't the end of the road for me.

I took the decision of replying to all of my spams.

I reply in a way that makes the *stupid* guy who sent it, and that is waiting for the one single person that will reply to his """Sir, I'm offering you monie""", feel awfully bad and down.
Most of the spams originate from Pakistan/India.
This is a fact and  I'm not being racist here:

So, this is it, enjoy your spams.
Post here what you think of this new way of fighting the spams.
*Philosophically*, will it make any impact, On me, On the spammer?

EDIT: This really diminished the spams I receive.

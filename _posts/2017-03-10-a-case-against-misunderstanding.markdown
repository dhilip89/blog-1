It has become rampant nowadays to find many persons misinterpreting or
skewing evolutionary psychology studies to praise or blame the stance
they fancy or despise.

The slants are non-sense and blot this relatively new field of social
science by conflating it with bigotry and excruciatingly non-scientific
arguments.

Many of the pernicious individuals that advance them are confabulating
and fabricating ideas to fit their world view.

Their truculent piffles are due to multiple complex misunderstandings
and internal fears.

One of them relates to a common confusion about the definition of the
term "scientific theory". A so common confusion that it has become an
adage that the ignoramus abuses to spurt out, in an officious manner,
blatantly wrong statements.

If someone would just hearken and spend a few of their precious time,
time already sacrificed to apish behavior, to read a simple definition,
it would extinguish this predicament.

Here are some of today's infectious ideas running rampant:

* Those studies are false there are no human universals
* AWALT - all women are like that - all like parasites
* AMALT - all men are like that - all violent sexual predators

From make belief to salacious thinking, all of those fall into the same
category: Individuals who are afraid of vagueness, that need a system
as a stronghold to their values, and a group to reinforce them.

Let's take the case of _"all women are like that"_. It is a strict system
built around the presumption that all women act in the exact same manner.

All strong claims need a strong base - It doesn't have any.

The movement is driven by the sexual lust of its practitioner.

It's a nefarious way of wanting to believe that there is a _"cheat
code"_ to life. In a sense it is similar to religious indoctrination
that requires the followers to close their eyes and see how their faith
metamorphoses itself everywhere; that everything will be alright if they
follow the scriptures.

There's nothing in any evolutionary psychology studies that ostentatiously
put forward anything close to _"all women are like that"_.

It's probable that they only perceive the section of truth that suits
them, discarding the rest into the abyss.

The situation with all the other cretinous ideas I mention is symmetrical.

Some of those sit on opposite end of the spectrum but share the same
criteria: they are extreme distorted world views.

It is ironic that an extreme idea always needs another extreme idea
on the other side of the spectrum to balance it and start an arms race
against it.

The hilarity lies in the fact that the persons who join one end may think
they are reducing the effect of the other end while it's the opposite:
they are contributing to the machinery of the arms race.

Like all dynamic systems, the ideas will continue to drift apart until
a cataclysm happens.

I hope I've cleared my stance on the matter.

This won't be enough to cover what I want but it efficiently deals with
the surface so it'll do.

For further reading, I amply discuss this topic on my [other
website](http://psychology.wtf) from a social dynamic aspect.

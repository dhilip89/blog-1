Yo readers,


> Girl I wanna wrap you, wanna lock you in my arms an' skin

> Woman I love the vibes, I love the spice, I love the passion you bring


Great lyrics, but the real thing is even better.

In this post you'll learn easy and safe ways to tie up someone.


####Getting The Material


For it to be fun the material should be something casual, your everyday item.

You need something long, that is solid enough to keep hold under pressure, and
flexible enough to be able to knot it and not hurt your partner.

I advice the followings:

* Belt
* Tie
* Shoelace


####Easy & Safe knots


The easiest way to do a knot is when you are tying someone to a solid place such
as a chair leg. You simply wrap is around and knot it the usual way.


Handcuffs knots are a bit more exciting.

Start with a straight line.


![Knot2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/knots/knot2.jpg)  


Do a q shape passing the left side over the right one.


![Knot3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/knots/knot3.jpg)  


Do a second q shape the same way.


![Knot4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/knots/knot4.jpg)  


Overlap the first q over the second one (the one on the top)


![Knot5]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/knots/knot5.jpg)  


Pass the two intersections into one another at the same time.
You can put the hands of the person inside at that point.

You can resize the space using the two bit of the cord left.
When you are done make the space around the hands as small as possible using the
two sides of the chord while at the same time taking hand apart from each others.


This knot works well with small chords.


![Knot7]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/knots/knot7.jpg)  


This one should start with the hands inside at the beginning.
Wrap the chord around them not leaving too much space between the hands.


![Knot8]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/knots/knot8.jpg)  


When you are satisfied start to wrap the chord the other way around, vertically.


![Knot9]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/knots/knot9.jpg)  

To close the know pass the rest of the chord to the little space left between
the wrist and the middle knot.


This knot works better with a longer chord.


####Know Where To Stop


Being dominant is a big turn on but remember that all parties should consent on
the act. Be respectful, talk about it before engaging into anything of the sort.

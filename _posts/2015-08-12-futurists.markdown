Hello fellow readers,  
In this post I'll introduce futurists, some people with a very special occupation.


> Unfortunately, about half the population are dead from the neck up. I've found that one of the things that makes a successful company is only hiring alive people. If you continue with that, you can have a pretty good company.


I would dare to say that 95% of the world population lives aimlessly.
They are predictable beings, following a well known path. We draw them
dots on their maps and all they have to do is join the lines.


> monkey see, monkey do!


A true no-brainer. Why look further, it's the easy solution.


Everyday you hear the same types of conversations from the same type of people
going through the same phases in their lives.


Even when they pitifully try to be unique by endorsing an emerging trend
it just turns them into phonies. How many times have you noticed a fashion
style infecting regions over a period of months.


Certainly, we have multiple ethnicities, cultures, morphologies, but the big
idea is still relevant.


Just a bunch of walking clichÃ©s.


It doesn't take much to get out of the mob, just creativity. Creativity is
acting in unexpected ways, ways that weren't on those well drawn lines.


The hard reality is that the percentage of *living* people won't raise. Your
average dude will always be your average dude. It's way too comforting to know
that everything will go well just by flowing through life without risks.


It's an unconscious behavior. It's what evolution has brought us, a safer way
to our deathbeds.


If everyone is so straight forward why not use and abuse it?
That's what the brain waves of some of the smartest persons on earth do,
the futurists.


###Futurists###


Take a step back.  
Take a *BIG* step back.  
Can you foresee where our civilization is going?
Can you get out of the current mindset, account for what it is and find all
its blind spots?
Can you say something about our future that isn't already known by all of us?
Can you see the big movements and tell us where this is leading?
What is the masses looking for, what are their current and future needs?
What technology will spurt out?


This is what [futurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist) do, they are the visionaries of their time.
They are constantly trying to clean the windows of their perception that have
been darkened by society. They want a clear and objective view.


They research and predict events, inventions, big movements, changes in
mentalities, everything related to human progression and behavior.


> Futurists or futurologists are scientists and social scientists whose specialty is futurology, or the attempt to systematically explore predictions and possibilities about the future and how they can emerge from the present, whether that of human society in particular or of life on Earth in general.


It can be used in a multitude of disciplines, any place that needs decision
making. When facing a dilemma and in need of a clear strategy a group of futurists is
a great option.

The range where it can be applied is extremely wide, it opens a lot of
opportunities.


####Where and who are futurists?####


We could say that by joining the results of the researches that everyone that
has a job related to foresight would give futurists.
However, it's not a bunch of dispersed unrelated people
that are gathering statistics about market shares, weather, psychology, and others, that make up futurists.

They do have a projected vision to accomplish their job but futurology seeks further.


Futurists are usually gathered in what we call "[Think Tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank)", which are non-profit research institutes.

[This article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/15/AR2005051501035.html) explains well in what consist those institutes.


There are think tanks in a multitude of countries.
A well known one is the [RAND](http://www.rand.org/), Research ANd Development, in the US.(More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation))


Their slogan is:


> To be the world's most trusted source for policy ideas and analysis.


They stand up to that reputation with modesty.

> Thirty-two recipients of the Nobel Prize, primarily in the fields of economics and physics, have been involved or associated with RAND at some point in their career.


_NB: Each prize is worth US$1.2 million_


Other than think tanks there are organisations and places that gather futurists.
I cannot vouch for the liability of those organisations, as the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Professional_Futurists) also mentions.


* [WSF](http://www.wfs.org/home.php) (World Future Society).
* [futurist.com](http://www.futurist.com/)
* [profuturists](http://profuturists.org/futurists)
* [Association of Professional Futurists](http://associationofprofessionalfuturists.org/)
* [Emergent By Design](http://emergentbydesign.com/tag/futures/)


You can also find them in organisations that do long running bets, which I'll
discuss later in this article. Or, simply scattered around the internet.


####Well Known Futurists####


The most notable futurists are probably [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), the father of computing and [John Forbes Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.), the inventor of the game theory (who died recently on May 23, 2015).


Both of them worked for the RAND organisation and both of them have worked on
extraordinaries and revolutionaries theories.


#What Is Needed To Be A Futurist


Being a futurist is not easy. It's not about lying down with burning incense
and chanting voodoo songs until you get a glimpse of the future.
It's a quest to fight yourself and society's ideologies within yourself.


> The [Zeitgeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist), spirit of the time, is the intellectual fashion or dominant school of thought that typifies and influences the culture of a particular period in time. 


The Wikipedia article mentions "a particular period of time" but this could
also be a particular geographical spot.
For instance, different countries have different Zeitgeists, different through
time and place.

That might explain why traveling is a great method to open yourself.


Each of those "spirits of time" have blind spots. They put you in such
condition that anything outside of the current ideologies is unimaginable.


What futurists do is dig in those blind spots, employing and mixing knowledge
coming from fields such as psychology, mathematics, computer science,
economics, sociology, history, and biology.


#History


If there's one thing we can learn from human history it's that it always
repeat itself over and over again. It's the same cycle, the same pattern but
with different actors and different scenes.

There are explanations anchored deep inside our brain for that, we'll discuss some
of them.


#Psychology


> Psychology is the study of mind and behavior.


> Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.


Isn't it the perfect definition. By understanding how human beings think we
can definitely get out of the blind spot and have an objective opinion.
Once we do that we can move on and deal with the problems we are facing.


The branches of psychology that interest the futurist are not the ones applied
to single individuals but the ones applied to big populations.


#Group Dynamics


> [Group dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_dynamics) is a system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group (intragroup dynamics), or between social groups (intergroup dynamics). The study of group dynamics can be useful in understanding decision-making behavior, tracking the spread of diseases in society, creating effective therapy techniques, and following the emergence and popularity of new ideas and technologies. Group dynamics are at the core of understanding racism, sexism, and other forms of social prejudice and discrimination. These applications of the field are studied in psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, epidemiology, education, social work, business, and communication studies.


That seems more interesting than the generic psychology definition.
With group dynamics we are focusing on movements within society.

Sociology is a broad subject but important to the futurist.

It's true that social sciences are exhaustive in reading content but you
can't avoid them if you want to wake up to the world.

Here's a list of topics that are good reads to get started with sociology:

* [Social psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology)
* [Groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink)
* [Group cohesiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_cohesiveness)
* [Group conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_conflict)
* [Transference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference)
* [Realistic conflict theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory)
* [Discontinuity effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuity_effect)
* [Relative deprivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_deprivation)
* [Poverty threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold)
* [Poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty)


This is the tip of the iceberg.


#Game theory

> [Game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) is the study of strategic decision making. Specifically, it is "the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers."

How do relations morph when facing problems and decisions? Which individual
will prevail? What are the best choices to make in certain situations considering
the current population? Those are all questions that are answered by game
theory. ([The Evolution of Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation))


They do it using mathematical models, matrices of decisions, sometimes
accompanied by evolutionary programming concepts to be able to anticipate
decisions through a changing environment.


> The emergence and abundance of cooperation in nature poses a tenacious and challenging puzzle to evolutionary biology. Cooperative behavior seems to contradict Darwinian evolution because altruistic individuals increase the fitness of other members of the population at a cost to themselves. Thus, in the absence of supporting mechanisms, cooperation should decrease and vanish, as predicted by classical models for cooperation in evolutionary game theory, such as the prisoner's dilemma and public goods games.


More resources:

[This virtual lab](http://www.univie.ac.at/virtuallabs/) has examples of
situations studied by game theory with visual outputs.

To get the idea:
A recent article called [Natural police](http://aeon.co/magazine/society/game-theorys-cure-for-corruption-make-us-all-cops/)
from the aeon magazine put forward a beautiful display of game theory and how
it can be inspired by the animal kingdom. It's the perfect example of
Good Games, or [Via Freedom to Coercion](http://www.univie.ac.at/virtuallabs/VolPun/).


A [research](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/research/) by David Rand shows a
schema of how game theory can be applied to current capitalist societies.

[The Compleat Strategyst](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/commercial_books/2007/RAND_CB113-1.pdf)
is the best introduction book to game theory.


Plenty of research papers on game theory are available on the [rand website](http://www.rand.org/topics/game-theory.html).


#Probability, Predictions, and Bets


Information about previous events and history, theories of anticipation, and
game theory gives us access to situational statistics that help calculate
the probability of something happening or not.


This is just speculation but with the right data it can be put to good end.


Some take it a step further and wage huge amounts of money over long prediction
bets.

Here are some websites for prediction bets:

* [predictionbook](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/future)
* [longbets](http://longbets.org/)
* [futuretimeline](http://www.futuretimeline.net/)


An internet writer, gwern, has a [long article](http://www.gwern.net/Prediction%20markets) about the prediction market.


I quote:

> A prediction can be broken up into 3 steps:
> 
> The specification
>
> The due-date
>
> The probability
>


Gwern's association with the black market doesn't remove the hostility about those
kind of places.


However, all of this is equivalent to betting at the casino if the persons
involved don't support their claims with real objective data.

Moreover, it's good to note that most companies do those kind of statistical
analysis when predicting how much material they'll need to buy to refill their
stocks.

Futurists simply use that technique as a mean to an end. It's not statistics
that'll give them the idea of the century.


#Evolutionary Psychology


Evolution is the Pandora box to human secrets. It's the root of all causes.


Most psychological theories ignore evolutionary processes and their values.
But plenty, if not all, phenomena can be explained through evolutionary psychology.

This field of study is about proving that group behaviors in today's society
is the effect of some ancestral behaviors in the hunter-gatherer
society and that we act this way as a mean of survival.

[The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Handbook-Evolutionary-Psychology-David-Buss/dp/0471264032/)
is the best resource available on the subject.



#Rulers Of The World


Now that you've got a bit of an idea of what futurists know about, you
can grasp how powerful they are. It's as if they knew exactly what was going
to happen to the world.
They could get control of the trends in a positive way for mankind or
do the opposite.


Considering that futurists are working their brains inside think tanks we might
assume that some powerful entities can steal their research, or ask for their
help.

Rulers can take control of the masses and mitigate revolts or unwanted
responses.


A little video by Stefan Molyneu named [The Story of Your Enslavement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbp6umQT58A)
displays, in a extravagant and caricatured manner, how the _dead_ men are taken
advantage of.



Humankind needs a revolution!

Not a violent revolution but a revolution in the learning process. Children
should all be taught about their roots, about evolutionary psychology.
If we could institute in them the understanding of life it would make living
in society better.
We are adaptable beings, we can drift from our chosen path,
the path chosen by millenniums of history.


If only that was possible...


#Conclusion


I hope that after reading this article you've taken a liking to those fabulous
persons that are futurists. I hope you'll also try to unplug yourself from your
zeitgeist.

You might think that you did but did not. We cannot know.


Cheers!

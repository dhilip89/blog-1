Hello fellow readers,  
In this post I'll try to explain a principle of life very hard to grasp.


A lot of people have boring lives. They go on with the tides, as if controlled
by forces of nature. They don't really have any real goal or purpose. They are
puppets of their own body. This category is the most sensible to ads, publicities,
propaganda, and multimedia.


Some try to fill up all their time with meaningless and unimportant activities.
Trying to make up for their inability to choose their path. Those people
usually give up someday and go back to letting themselves go with the flow.
They are trying to entertain themselves for as long as they can hiding
the fact that it's useless if you aren't aiming for anything higher.
In the worst case, they are just immitating someone else's life.


All they can talk about is where they've been and what they did, nothing too deep.


Two of my favorite quotes depict this exact situation:


> "Busyness" is a social defense against other people making us do things we don't really want to 
> do and a mechanism for coping with feeling guilty about things we know we should do, but don't. 
> My intuition is that people have had to project themselves as busier and busier over the 
> last couple decades as technology has made us more efficient in order for this strategy to 
> continue working.
> 
> If you're always "so busy!", your boss is less likely to give you more work; your spouse is 
> less likely to ask you to do more around the house; you're not going to feel as guilty about 
> only seeing grandma once a year or refusing to help your friend move; you can feel a little better 
> about yourself when a friend lands an awesome new job or plans a cool vacation and you haven't 
> really done anything. When you haven't seen someone in a long time and they ask how things are, 
> 	   you can give them the impression that things must be even better than the last time you saw them, 
> 	   because you've clearly been so busy improving your lot in life. Well, that's the idea, at least.


> I can't help but wonder whether all this histrionic exhaustion isn't a way of covering up the 
> fact that most of what we do doesn't matter.

Others are drawn into unexpected events and keep attracting them one by one.
Be it voluntary or involuntary, those events force them to strike and
fight back for their life, to fight to find their path to a better living.


The first truth is that life events are mostly unexpected. You fall into them
similarly to the people that are floating on the water and suddenly find themselves
near a waterfall. They have to react and wake up from their relaxed, dreamy,
and cosy sleep.


The second truth is that everyone has lived at least one of those life changing
events. However, not everyone has had the courage to build themselves up. Blindness
is built by your environment. You can feel it while talking to others, the
shallowness and emptiness. Lying to others is one thing, lying to oneself is
another. Surrounding yourself with a big bubble won't help. I despise those persons.


The third truth is that there are people living those events every single day
of their life. Constantly reminded that they shouldn't give up, that they shouldn't
drown into that so warm and attractive water. Similar to those individuals there
are those that lived a bunch of those events but that were so strong that they
marked them with fire. They are of the same kind.


Obviously those unexpected life events builds up who you are, it goes deep
inside your personality. Without them you wouldn't be you, without them you
would be another puppet. It's your own story.

You move from places to places, from faces to faces.


You don't look back, you continue writing in the book of life. You don't bring
back ghosts of the past. You don't bring back people, you don't bring back ideas,
you don't bring back parts and bits of life. What is done is done. They were
things done at the moment. Yourself of today is an evolved version of the one
in the past, you aren't the person you used to be, you've been morphed through
your actions.


So when the time comes when things are brought back, be it a face, someone you
thought you would never see again, an event that reproduce itself, ask yourself
will reentering the past bring anything more to my new self. Would the person
I am today want to go back and live again the events of the past. Am I really
going to force myself back into my old state of mind.


Don't endanger your life by reopening scars. Move on!


Good times are good times, you don't bring them back, you keep them around.

Psychology studies how talking about impactful events of our past helps healing
your mental health.
However, this is the case if you weren't aware of those memories. For instance,
childhood memories are the base of all our thinking.


In the case where you are fully aware of them discussing them means putting yourself
in a situation where you are completely open to the individual you are discussing with.
It's as if you gave them full rights over your life. You are giving them something
that you wouldn't even trust yourself with. Your deepest inner secrets, the secret
key to your cellar door.

Meanwhile, you discuss with others that you know didn't even apprehend the concepts
I'm writing about in this article. People without purpose. The content of their
oration seems so benign.


It's spectacular how life can be complex.

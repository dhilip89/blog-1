Hello fellow readers,
This post is a meditation.


Last week a group conversation with friends that jumped from one subject
to another lead me to browse the source of an old program I wrote.


As I was re-discovering it I kept thinking about the transitions I made in
the world of programming. That program was from the days where I was getting the
funkiest ideas.


The source codes I keep on my laptop are like photo albums, they are a
collection of thoughts that reminds me of who I was.


However, unlike pictures, I keep them around for reuse and updates.


They are my ever-changing state of mind.

This behavior made me wonder about the meaning of the past.


I had already set myself to write about the subject when another event happened.


"The Little Prince", a story I read when I was a little boy, is going to have,
yet again, a movie interpretation next week. I saw the trailer the last time I
went to the cinema but couldn't remember it at the time.


What brought the memory back was a blog post, ["The Little Printf"](http://ferd.ca/the-little-printf.html), that tells a
caricatured story about persons in the programming field.


Soon after, I sat on the couch, relaxing, and sipping tea with my significant
other while, together, we read my childhood story.


For two hours we were enchanted.


![Little Prince]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/little_prince.jpg)


I had forgotten about the magic of the story. All I could remember was that it
made me happy. There was a high school day where we went to a place, probably a
museum, where they had a huge room with stars and projectors to play a story
based on the little prince.


I was spiraling down in my thoughts...


There are times when you need to take a break and check where you stand.
You look backward, the paths you've taken, and forward, the paths you can take.


These are strong moments, they stop you from thinking.
They are moments of confusion.


_The mind is stuck._


You can choose to continue your journey but it'll be in a mechanized fashion,
like a bumper car that moves through life driven by external stimuli.


> It's time for self-reflexion.


![stuck]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stuck_reflect.jpg)


It's never repeated enough; know yourself before knowing others, love yourself
before loving another.


All the beautiful principles of morality are based on this.


I've been on the happy roller-coaster recently.
Good events and good mood attract good events and good mood.

It's a [virtuous circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle).
If I'm happy I want others to be happy and they will want me to be happy and together
we'll create events that will make more persons happy.


*I've been working hard on that.*


It's paradoxical that before this I was so _down_ that I had to swam clumsily
out of a mud of tears.


At the time moving fast would have left me with scars. Assessing my situation
is what helped me grow.


I've never been at that level of easiness with my conscience.

My comfort is the key to know and discover what I'm looking for and what
deeply makes me content in this short life on earth.

I wrote this paragraph in an earlier post about memories that should not be
brought back.


Nevertheless, there are some that needs to.


A memory surfaces because it hasn't been processed correctly.

Pull it out, look at it straight, analyze it, understand it, make love to it,
and once you are done put it back and never touch it again.


The scars will stay open if they never healed.


![wannabe strong]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/strong.jpg)


What a strange thing to look back at past events.


Old pictures of yourself, old projects, old success, old errors.


It's a shame that pictures have lost their meanings.
Digitalization has sucked he soul out of their magnificence.


The selfies movement is a calamity.


Then it strikes!

Let's open the cellar door...  
Let's lay out the secrets that even your own self doesn't know about.


![cellar door]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cellar.jpg)


What an intriguing phenomena to enter your own thoughts.


Melancholy, nostalgia, bittersweetness? No words fits the right description.


Do we miss ourself, are we a different person?


Is the mind a continuity of what it was or does it rebuilds itself over and
over again.


There has been extensive debates about our learning process and our identity.


Some argue that we are born with a simple minimal and generic algorithm - what's
needed to make us survive - and that it's polished by our environment.


Others argue that there's no generic function but multiple modules that each have
specific tasks, communicate, and learn together through a complicated network.


A layer above those there are filtering and error systems.
The ones that traces what could be or is necessary for our survival and what is
not.
Systems that have been running for thousands of years.


Is our mind a neural network that has been well trained or are we more...


![my mind]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/inner.jpg)


Are we really different from our past self?

It's a rather odd thing that evolution created a self-reflecting being that can
also reflect and think about the evolution itself.


We are the mirror the universe created to see itself.


We might not realize the magnificence and beauty of the action of thinking of
our own past.


_It's the infinite recursion of our own existence._


How can our mind keep track of its previous states, how can it go back to it; if
it ever can.

Memories are deep encrusted in our head.

Are there multiple layers with different states that we keep throughout our
life. What criteria is used to separate one state from another?


It's very unlikely that it is this way.


It's more probable that the brain is a network that grows through time.
It can relate to older versions of itself because they have similar forms.
They have the same root but not the same leaves.


It knows the past is just a smaller version of itself.


But what if there are alterations made to the part that was the similarity
between past and present.


There ought to be alterations if the network grows and get better over time.


If it is not the case, it's mechanism is beyond our current knowledge.


Otherwise, it explains why we feel like strangers to our own selves.


![strangers with myself]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/stranger.jpg)


How we can remember our old state is still unsolved.


There's a difference that keeps nagging us.


We blame ourselves for things we might have done differently.


We feel like we want to go back in time to do some corrections.


There's an urge to correct that might be a higher level of the correction urge
that happens in our brain.


We are in a waiting state with a queue of unprocessed events.
They are taken as inputs when the network is ready to recalibrate itself.
And when memories are brought back it's time to incorporate them.


It's a recursive self-calibrating system that strive for equilibrium.


> Dreams exist for that reason, fixing and training.


![higher mind]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/higher.jpg)



We laugh at how silly and stupid we were. We can't believe it really was us.


We then suddenly feel like time is going by.
The noticeable footprints it has tells us that life is short.


We realize of how small we are.


We look at others in hope for comfort but only to reach out to people running
away from us.


Running away to reach for the empty palpable.


We then feel nothingness, dissatisfied, we want happiness so we run too.


We are hunted by our status.

It drives us towards making new changes in our ephemeral life for the sake of
of our ancestor.

Centuries and generations of behaviors reminds us of what we are here for.

We are the last entities of our descendant, the others have failed to reproduce.


_We are the survivors._


This fact kicks our instinct in the self-morphing creature that we are.


It's paradoxical that our insignificance has a higher significance as a specie.


> All of that just by thinking of the past...

Self-knowledge is an important part of our well being.


> Know yourself before knowing others, love yourself before loving another.


However we must realize we have a long way to go.

*And we move on!*

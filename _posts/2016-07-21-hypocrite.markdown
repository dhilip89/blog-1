I just don't know!  
<pre>




</pre>
What to do when you keep giving but the sight of the fruits you are nurturing
are so far away, blocked by legions of hungry animals...
<pre>



</pre>
You keep walking, high in spirit, telling everyone about the future harvest and
no one listens.

Is anyone ever going to listen?

They crave what you've been working on and will eat and destroy it before maturity.

Yet they nag about their own rotten and putrid food.



You keep feeling urged and discontent;   
Urged to close that chapter - a simple and plausible solution.  
Discontent about yourself giving up - for being an hypocrite.


Satisfaction isn't something achievable, this idea is anchored in your mind.
You won't be able to stand in the shadow of the trees you've grown, you know
those trees are likely to be destroyed when you are gone.

You know that.


Yet, the temptation of hate resurfaces.


Degenerated retarded apes.

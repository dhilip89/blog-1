Hello fellow readers,

This week is TTY week at `nixers.net`.

Last summer we did the same challenge and it turned out a pretty enjoyable and great learning experience.

I'm going to post logs in this post and hopefully it'll render beautifully (because I can't check my blog from the TTY.)


##Day 1


I started the [timer clock](https://github.com/nixers-projects/tty-week-timer) on my server so that anyone can keep track of how much time is left for the challenge.
The script is simple, it kills any graphical session it finds open and updates the counter.


Last summer everyone had their bit of entertainment finding console games, for me it was vitetris.
I played it a bit and tried to get an efficient my tty workflow.

I'm using dvtm for multiplexing, the framebuffer for images, links -g for browsing the web,
and the rest stays the same as in X. Pretty easy when you are a minimalist.

One annoying thing is copy/pasting text from places to places.

I installed `gpm` which stands for general purpose mouse.

It's not exactly a mouse but a cursor in the console that helps copying text around.
It fills the most recent selection buffer (middle click).


##Day 2


I ssh into my work box, at my job, and do whatever I have to do from my home machine that I brought with me.
It's the simplest way to stick true to the TTY week without the hassle of setting up my work machine correctly.


Also, it's fun to be able to work with the `love of my life`.


Last year I used my own custom Perl script to check my mails but this time I wanted to have a go with new programs.
Thus, I've got alpine setup. The only drawback is that you cannot have multiple accounts.

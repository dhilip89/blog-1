###How  & why some people have better aptitudes


About a week ago an instructor at university was asking why most students did
not try the step by step tutorials at home, or why they didn't at least read
it. He then started a speech, trying to understand us and saying that we would
not be able to enter the work world easily with this mindset, and asking
students what they thought of it.

> "Students nag because they don't get enough
> practice and when they have to actually <strong>do</strong> something they nag that they
> weren't prepared enough for it." 

He then asked me and I was speechless. I could
not directly come up with the right words to express my opinion and thus I am
now writing an article about it. In this article I'll try to develop on the
subject by viewing multiple aspects of it, from descriptions, to social issues,
and psychology. Let's note that there aren't any particularly new ideas here,
a lot of research has already been made in this field
(<a href="http://beta.slashdot.org/story/208067">Nice article here</a>).

What makes some people able to solve real world problems more than others?
What's making some others go beyond the scope of their institutionalized
studies? What's the difference between people who study two days before an
exam and others who seem like they naturally know how to do the test?


A course is only three months long, which amount to a week of non-stop work. No
one will ever grasp a concept in a week, putting aside the mysteries of nature.
Assisting to a course is only the tip of the iceberg, it is not supposed to
teach a whole idea, it is supposed to initiate thoughts in students so they can
start learning and practicing on their own. However, this is not applied
thoroughly in the academic world, most are just satisfied with the small
portion of knowledge a course can have. They just go to class to study.



There's a humongous difference between the notion of studying and learning.
You might study ten hours a day but not actually learn a single thing. Studying
, according to my humble own definition, relates to memorizing, and learning to
understanding and grasping ideas. It is true though that in specific cases
there is a need to study terms and theorems in order to be able to learn but
it's rarely applicable once the basics have been acquired.


This differentiation matters, it is one tiny gap that can change an individual.


A nice example I like to take is the equal sign. To some it means <em>"the answer
is"</em> and to the rest <em>"is equivalent to"</em>. The latter is more correct. <em>"1+1=2"</em>,
one and one are equivalent to two but two isn't an answer. There's no question
here, there's no need for answers. It's very common to get confused between
those notions and people always tend to go for the first one. I have two
anecdotes related to this.
The instructor, who I mentioned earlier, always tells us to strive for lazy
solutions. He's referring to a solution that, once done, will scale through
time and environment. For most, the lazy solution is finding all the questions
and prepare themselves to answer them, or in the worst case, to just avoid
questions or knowledge.
Here's a quote from Paul Graham that fits perfectly here:

Asking the why and how of things is what is needed. On a side note, the 
students are not always to blame, the teachers sometimes contribute to the
vicious cycle of <em>"answering questions"</em> in multiple ways. It is more of a
social issue.


As I've mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph, society plays a huge
role in the way its citizens perceive education. In our current society (mine,
and not necessarily the reader's) education is mostly a simple way of getting a
job and making money. It's perceived as an obligation, a duty that your parents
and ancestors have forced upon you. It is not an enjoyable moment! On the
contrary the <em>smarts</em> are shamed as wasting precious time that they could spend
doing other capitalist activities.


I beg to differ on that view: education should be a magical moment. For
instance, Asian societies excel at this. They worship wise men and women, they
have exciting study lives, it's what matters to them. They are in love with
discovery. You can notice it a lot in their culture. Their work passionate
them all their lives.


When someone chooses their field of study, they'll also choose their way of life, it's
going to be the reason they walk on this Earth. Thus, the need to master the little
knowledge a human being can have because this is what you are worth. You are bound to your
knowledge, you are what you learn. There's a deep attachment between what you
work on and your personality, it's the mirror of your mind.


Consequently, thinking this way makes learning a whole new experience. There's
excitement and meaning in the process of slowly discovering new things. There's
thrill in searches and discoveries. All of it driven by curiosity, the why of
the previous section in addition to a feeling of insatiaty.
In other words: It should be fun to learn, it should be like getting new spells
and leveling up in RPGs. A new thing learned is a new toy.
Nowadays, the cool thing is that by simply being curious you can find all the
information and materials online for free. That is how I define curiosity and
from where it come from. Be an excited curious person.


On a side note, maybe being thought the way of the Asian culture as a kid can
help growing the curiosity in children. As a kid I also used to read manga
(Japanese comic books) and watch anime (Japanese animated cartoons). However,
I have no co-related data and statistics to prove my theory.



In conclusion, we can blame society for not letting people be curious or
influencing them in ways that make them avoid being. It makes me sad when my
comrades memorize the course without really <em>getting it</em>, it makes me sad when
I hear  

> "Imma just copy paste some code in the exam because the teach' didn't tell us
> how to answer anything in class."


Now it would be nice if we were able to transfer that <strong>excited curiosity</strong> from
one person to another, or at least influence them in such a way that they
can develop it on their own. That's what I'm trying to do, that's what teachers
should do. I know some who tries and I really respect that.


Cheers, thanks for reading.

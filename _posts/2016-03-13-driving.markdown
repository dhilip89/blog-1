Hello fellow readers,  
This article is about driving in Lebanon.

[I used to spend my whole day walking](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/philosophy/2015/08/26/on-my-way.html) until I bought a car.

Walking was time consuming and tiresome. On the long run I got used to it and
with my "wasted" time on transportation I read books, watched movies, and
listened to podcasts.  

I also had many adventures on my way.


I now still listen to podcasts in the car but I can't read while driving.

Let's see if what my eccentric friend told me was true or not:


> When you get a car you become a horrible person. You don’t care about others, you just want to pass through.

Let's first deal with the aspect that is not related to driving habits.  


Inside your car you are in a comfort zone. You start to ignore what
is happening around you, you don't even look at the mesmerizing mountain view
anymore.
You completely overlook the pedestrian and even direct anger and frustration at
them. You, indeed, "just want to pass through".


That truth hurts.


I'm constantly reminding myself of how I used to struggle to reach my
destinations. I let people hitchhike with me when I'm on my way to the village.
I try to give them the same push the great people I've met gave me. I hope to
never forget or get influenced by others' behavior.

When driving daily you don't meet nice people, on the contrary. You are faced
with worse than having to walk two hours everyday, being all sweaty, 
suffocating in buses, and having to fight to get a fair price from taxi drivers.


The mob and anonymity feelings people get while driving create monsters
of the road. Their self-esteem bursts out.
They are not themselves, they are driven by their vehicle.

Forcing ideas unto others never works, showing them and letting them learn does.

In this post I'm using a learning technique called _explorable explanation_.
Let's hope it contributes to someone's life, let's hope the children of tomorrow
can learn.


Let's stop the psychology and have fun listing the nasty habits that could
kill us one day.

###How To Drive For Others Guide###


* Driving on the line

_Explanation:_ 

This pathological case is frequent. A large number of people drive
with their cars aligned on the line, not between the lines but on the line itself.
This is an imminent danger to those who drive "normally" as they are blocking
half the road on both sides.

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Honk at them.


* Usage of lights


_Explanation:_ 

I'm not afraid of monsters at night, my horror stories are filled with other
things such as people trying to blind me using their high headlights.

I'm not sure why they do so, aren't those used in case of emergency.
If people get used to bright light what are they gonna do in situations
where they really need them. The answer is: go blind.

Aren't they already blinding themselves everyday with the politicians on TV.

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Unfortunately I have no answers.  
Try not to die my friends.


* Turn Signal Flashers

_Explanation:_ 

Turn Signals are used to notify the persons around you that you are
going to _turn_, change direction, so that they don't get the bad surprise at
a late second and make an accident.

This concept is stranger to many drivers around us.

You are driving behind someone when suddenly, for no apparent reason, they brake. You brake too in panic!
They then leave the highway without any signal.

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Honk at them.


* Cell Phones

_Explanation:_ 

A law has been placed to forbid the use of cellphones while driving, yet the
addiction to mobile devices is strong. Because of their quest to social
attention on computing devices the persons are becoming dangerous.

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Honk at them even more.


* Gas Consumption & Aggressive driving

_Explanation:_ 

Gasoline is costly.

When I started driving I didn't know about the practices to avoid
wasting gas. I listened to my father's advices on the subject. Moreover, in my
car I have a consumption meter which shows how much gas I'll be consuming if I keep
pressing on the pedal the way I'm currently pressing it.


One of the practices that uses the most gas is aggressive driving.  

The _Vrrrmmm_ that makes a lot of sound!

On the highway there's a certain speed you reached (around 80Km/H) that let
you drive consuming the least fuel possible.
The car moves by itself.


Those aggressive and impatient drivers are not only wasting their money but
are extremely dangerous.

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Honk at them.


* Road Signs

_Explanation:_ 

There's simply no respect of signalisation.
People drive the wrong way, drive above the speed limit, drive
on red light.
I've even seen more than once trucks getting stuck under bridges (4.85M) because they
didn't read the notice and had a vehicle higher than the bridge.

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Honk at them.


* Staying focused

_Explanation:_ 

It might also be a pathological case...  
Some persons have neck problems - they can't look on their side before
changing lanes.

They can't look before entering the highway either, on the contrary, they
speed up.

They are focused on what's happening in front of them, nothing else.

Appearances first, how do I look entering the highway.

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Honk at them.


* To Beyond

_Explanation:_ 

This is a special case by itself.  
The vehicle morphs into a suicide missile, throwing itself at
you, 125Km/H. So close it's almost going to hit.  
And suddenly it fires your eyes with its AK47 lighting set.

Begging to explode as soon as possible.

What's the rush about?

Maybe they think they are the king of the road and that all loyal subjects
should make place.

Even when the road is too narrow they want to cut you at all costs... And then
they stop and park 80 meters later.

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Don't let them pass, stay relaxed. You are in the right, the limit is 100Km/H.
Nothing's wrong with fighting stupidity.


* Ant Theory

_Explanation:_ 

Traffic in Lebanon is anarchy.  
People forget about the rules (as if), others, the lanes they were on,
the circulation, and more importantly, common sense.

They act like lost animals looking for empty spots to fill. This goes on until
the whole road is crammed with cars and no one can move anymore.

Just like in a funnel.

Ants are better at that, [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJ_6vju_U0)


_Test:_ (tap to play)

_What Can I Do About It:_  
Stay on your lane and leave enough space in front of you.  
It will make the traffic go faster. Think of it like a funnel, if the water only goes
through the middle opening it'll flow faster. As soon as other fluids come
from the sides it get stuck.

It'll certainly make the line longer but the traffic will be over instantly.

Also, don't let others "drive on the line" when they get stuck in traffic.

This explains the number of car accidents we have.

Let's show others we want a well ordered and respectful country.
Respect because those behaviors are unrespectful. To be respected
you have to respect.

There are many other things that need fixing but we have to start somewhere.  
Let's change this countrie's mindset of _impatient opportunistic exploitation_.

Thanks for reading,  
This was a bit what _explorable explanation_ is like.  
As usual if you like what I write about please buzz me and we'll have a beer together someday.

_Update 22-04-2016_:  

An article correlating driving habits and the overall situation in a country
just came out, [here](http://www.citymetric.com/horizons/streets-bucharest-how-road-behaviour-correlates-trust-government-2015)'s the link to it.

>  And this kind of makes sense too, as roads are almost a perfect microcosm of what states do on a larger scale. On a road network, you have many different actors all behaving in a self-interested manner, trying to reach their own goals – and in order to manage this efficiently, there are rules in place to try to try and make the whole thing more efficient. If, for some reason, people decide not to follow these rules, then the whole thing breaks down – and the result is chaos.

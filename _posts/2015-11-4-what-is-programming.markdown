Hello fellow readers,  
In this post I'll discuss what programming and computing are for me.


Disclaimer: I had this post in mind for a long time. I recently met Oday Maleh
who has a Youtube channel called [Dry culture](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS4dsIMOKXAfPlgCTt4QOvQ). Oday is a phenomenal person and his channel reflects a lot of the ideas
I'm going to discuss here, if not all. He's a mind-brother.


Computers are tools.


Their functions can be summed to entertainment, utility, and information.


It's common to find persons loosing themselves to a tool, slave to their
creation.


Programming is something useful.


It's a big domain where you learn languages to instruct a machine to take actions.
Those instructions can range from outputting things (maybe screen pixels but not
limited to that), taking inputs from the outside world (not necessarily a
keyboard or mouse), doing calculations at very high speed, storing data, and
transferring data.


There are two kinds of programmer dilemmas: the ones who build parts for other
programmers to use and the ones who build for end-users real programs to
solve problems.


It's common to find persons that forget to whom their tool is for, frightening
others with jargons and technical issues they don't care about.


While building something as the first kind of programmer no real accomplishment
is made. Success is rare in this category and it's hard to innovate and
satisfy others. Even programmers themselves don't care about the implementation
details. Those programmers should be humble, brave, and patient. The K&R duo is
a fine example of this. They are the authors of the C programming language and
UNIX operating system on which run almost every platform today. Yet, who of your
non-techie friends has ever heard their names. Ask them about Steve Jobs or
Bill Gates instead.


It's common to find persons that seek non-stop attention for building blocks,
craving the look of others because they can't be fulfilled by humble work.


Things are build for someone to use and this someone is yourself most of the time.


It's common to find persons that build things they would never use.


Let's not forget the essential.


Programming is an immense power, it makes you a creator.


It's satisfying to see ideas taking concrete shape to become real.


On the path to the goal there are obstacles that are also learning experiences.
Motivation for the end goal helps you climb the mountain.


It's common to find persons that have replaced the whole idea of programming by
the techniques. They forget that it's just a mean to an end.


Nevertheless, it's exciting to learn and be able to do things only a few can
but not very useful on its own.
It's not contributing to anyone's life.


Even researchers don't do that. They have goals and projects that innovates.


It's common to find person that are learning simply to brag to their peers.


There should be something driving you to code and learn, curiosity, or the
pleasure of creation, or anything.


It's not all about logic, imagination is deeply involved in the process.


If someone ever say that programming is very strict and that it requires
a head full of algorithms and maths, that person is wrong.


Programming is like asking a sculptor for a piece. Every sculptor has his
own technique, his touch, his peculiar way of thinking, and imagination.


Does the person asking for the beautiful piece of art care about what he was
thinking while sculpting, in what manners he hold his tools, and what he has been
taught by his teacher to be able sculpt this way?


Probably not.

Maybe a bit if the person is also a sculptor.


Would the sculptor enjoy his work if it only was about techniques and books?


Probably not.


The sculptor enjoys taking a bit from all the techniques he has learned and
found, mix them together to make them his own to be able to create brand new
master pieces that bring joy to the community. Pieces that can bring smiles.


Who would want to stay near a sculptor that only talks about his techniques?
Who would want to stay near a sculptor that only talks about how much money
he can make out of his work?


And behind every sculptor there are carpenters and other workers preparing the
tools.


Programmers are not the only ones in the field of computing, it's an ecosystem.


We got our immune system, the hackers and pentesters, we got our artists, the
graphic designers, we got our engineers, we got our cleaners, we got our
business man, we got from everything.


I'm no mathematician.
I'm no crazy PhD dude who spends hours to explain simple ideas using complex words
I'm no graphic designer, even though I try to make my programs look visually appealing.
I'm no graphic programmer, I can't make raster graphics or analyse the graphics and special effects of video games.
I'm no frontend-nodejs.io genius, my webpages are simple.
I'm not a low-level, kernel, operating system developer, even though I really enjoy Unix boxes.


In fact I'm almost nothing.
I'm not defined by what I do.
I'm more than that.


I'm best at what I do worse and I'm happy with it.


See you around folks!

Thanks again Oday!

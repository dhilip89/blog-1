It's been four months since [the last
post](https://venam.nixers.net/blog/psychology/2017/03/06/projets-2017.html)
about my personal projects and endeavours. These past months following,
slowly but steadily, on the activities I had set the pace for previously.


### Books ###

_Language: literature_  
_Explanation_: I've been reading quite a lot, more than I thought I did
now that I glance back at the list.  

- In Over our heads (The mental demands of modern society) - Robert Kegan
- Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari
- The Language Instinct - Steven Pinker
- The Richest Man in Babylon - George S. Clason
- The Righteous Mind - Jonathan Haidt
- The Mysterious Benedict Society - Trenton Lee Stewart
- Beej's guide to C programming

And more...

My definitive recommendation in this list is "In Over our Heads". It's
a mind blowing and captivating piece. Not a hard one to go through but
a hard one to ponder about.

On a side not, for those interested in manga, I've finally got myself
to create a package version of my manga downloader.

It's specifically for 64bit Linux:

Check it [here](https://github.com/venam/MangaDL--CPP-GUI-Version-/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha).


### June Events ###


_Language: community_  
_Explanation_: This year, similar to the last two years, we did some
special events for June on [nixers.net](https://nixers.net).  

Those consisted of:

- A programming/projects week

Where I've spent my time adding `multipart/alternative` to the newsletter
sending script so that it allows both plain text and html versions.


I've also start contributing to [thelostt ricing
book](https://github.com/thelostt/ricing), which looks promising.

- A music week

I had plan to setup a music streaming service for nixers but we got
bugged down on the license and legal issues.

- A retro-ricing week

The goal was to create a sort of "retro-style" desktop.
This is what I came up with:

- A week in the TTY

This was the usual week in the TTY.

- A monthly mini-scavenger hunt

I spent some hours to come up with a good small mini-hunt for the
community. This is what I came up with: It has some crypto, some
Unix-specific thing, some small fun parts, etc..

It's still online for those interested.


### Crypto ###


_Language: Maths_  
_Explanation_: The last few weeks I had to deal with a lot of cryptography
and certificate related tasks at my job. I've found it rather interesting
and so I had to go deeper in the subject. I started consuming a lot
of content related to cryptography. The math is a bit hard to refresh
because it's been a long time but it's still fascinating.

I've contributed to a [certificate verification
lib](https://github.com/venam/trantor-certificate-verifier) in java
and finally was able to learn how to use the openssl command line tool
(and find its limitation concerning elliptical curves and regarding
certificate name constraints extensions)


### Podcast & Newsletter ###

_Language: Unix_  
_Explanation_: Amazing isn't it? The podcast and the newsletter have
moved a long way since I've started with the ideas. They are now well
polished and interesting.

So far we've got 7 new episodes since the last time, four months ago. This
isn't a lot but I didn't allocate enough time to focus on those.

We now have 32 newsletter issues in total, that's 20 more than four
months ago... And that's a lot of cool content to read and keep up with.

Be sure to subscribe to the [newsletter](https://nixers.net/newsletter/).

I've got hold of the nixers.net domain and so no more spam for the
newsletter.

I've also been wondering if I should push the content to a broader
audience. I've started distributing some episodes on my blog in a more
readable format. Maybe others will find value in those.


### 2bwm ###

_Language: C_  
_Explanation_: Finally, I've started refactoring 2bwm!  

The new version is in preparation in the [2bwm_refactor
branch](https://github.com/venam/2bwm/tree/2bwm_refactor) on github.
This new version will be more efficient by utilizing hashes instead of
linked list, this will have the effect of a search of `O(1)`. It'll also
have a cleaner code base, workspaces per monitors and much more.

I'm hyped about this.


### Psychology ###

_Language: brains_  
_Explanation_: I've been ingesting a lot of content and regurgitating
(not really) it back in many online arguments. I feel like I'm learning
every day about myself and others around me. I've posted a bunch of
articles related to conversations I've had with individuals I care about:

- [Cross Culture Frustration]({{site.baseurl}}/psychology/2017/07/05/culture-frustration.html)
- [Why Deliberate Positive Illusion Is Important]({{site.baseurl}}/psychology/2017/05/23/deliberate-positive-illusion.html)
- [A Case Against Misinterpretations]({{site.baseurl}}/psychology/2017/03/10/a-case-against-misunderstanding.html)

I've also added a new cycle to my evolutionary psychology cycles/mind-maps
list:

- [The Mapping Of Social Coherence](https://psychology.wtf/social_coherence.php)


### Ascii & Drawings ###


_Language: art_  
_Explanation_: I'm going down the abstract route now, even in ascii arts.

## Now ##


This is a small update on my previous state.

My experiment with donations on Patreon didn't go really well, only
[tejr](https://sanctum.geek.nz/) is supporting me at the moment.

The fees are of extensive, $25 per transfer which doesn't help either:  

- 12% going to Patreon
- $20 fix rate by Payoneer
- $5 fix rate by the bank

I'm still going to strive on that path.

Now that I've got hold of the domain name nixers.net I'll work on setting
up an encrypted mail server using public/private keys schemes and I'll
share sub-domains with the members.

I'll also be working on a context-like menu using xcb. I haven't found
any that was satisfying enough. It's going to be small, lightweight,
clean, support for xft, and good looking.

I've got plans to continue contributing to the local guide map on gmaps
but for that I'll have to repair my car A/C, which will take a while.

Overall I'm still looking for passive income, my ideas at the moment
are vaporous, they're give away for good will but I don't know if I can
sustain that rhythms.

I might start working on some freelance jobs that fit in my free time
but for that I might have to give up on my hobbies, which is not very fun.

Anyway, all is good, good is all!

As usual...  
If you want something done, no one’s gonna do it for you, use your own hands.

And let’s go for a beer together sometime, or just chill.

Hello fellow readers,  
In this post I'll discuss a subject that has been nagging me.


> Justification After Actions


I usually write to clear my mind about a topic. These days I can't really keep
up with all the things that bug me. This subject is a preparation to a broader
subject that I'm preparing to write about.


If you've been following this blog, or know me personally, you would have noticed
that I like analyzing human behavior and psychology, especially in groups.
I love to read about it, write about it, do simulations of it, I'm inspired by
it. In this end it all comes down to digging information from evolution.

It's the secret of life. Don't we say that knowing oneself is the only true
way to happiness.

But can we really control our deepest instincts, what we've been programmed to
reply to?
Simply being told the hard truth about our fundamentals helps.


This post will deal with something that can, to an extent, be controlled if we
take the time to reflect about it.


---------------------------------------



You have certainly experienced a situation where a person took a decision and
then tries to explain the reasons why they took it.
However, your guts tell you that there's something more, it wasn't just logic.


That person is everyone of us.


A simplistic scenario would unroll this way:


* Face a problem or decision making
* Analyse possible outcomes objectively
* Choose what to do accordingly
* Justify actions based on the previous analyse


We don't live in a perfect world, human beings are way more complicated
that than this oversimplified routine.
Our brains are complex networks and the hidden layers of thoughts have an
astonishing depth.


It's what we refer to as subconscious.


Let's sum up the ways in which one can handle decision making.
We'll then develop each one separately and explain how the justification comes into play.


* Instinct
* Objective Thoughts
* Social Pressure & Group Behavior
* Recurrent Hidden Thinking Aka Effect Of Child Abuse


#### Instinct####


We are animals and have basic needs.  
Even though we have reached a state where we're practically master of our
instincts they are still what drives us everyday. All the other ways of
thinking are just extensions of the instinct, a fancier way of keeping our specie
alive.

What's rather strange is that the more we evolved the less we embraced our simplest
needs. If we had to justify that action we'll certainly give it
a higher importance than what it was. It happens all the time.

The corporations abuse it and make businesses out of it.

In the worse scenarios we even blame our rightful basic natural instincts. It
goes without saying that we are a social specie and some order is needed but
it doesn't mean that we should ignore and hide the fact that most of what we do
is to fulfill those basic needs.

We probably reached a point where we are blind to our own selves.


For example, We ask a person to choose between two different meals.

He chooses the one that smelled better, the one that has the best color, the best
texture. Those are attributes we've learned through thousands of years of
evolution that helped us differentiate edible and energetic food.

It is laughable that those attributes can be engineered and faked. A lot of
what we see today is faked and plays with our instincts, and I'm not only
talking about food.


#### Objective Thoughts####


The "objective thoughts" is what we see in books.  
I personally don't believe it's used enough apart from when studying, discovering,
and analysing.

It's a game of weighting the points that would make you do one thing instead of
another. Weighting the personal benefits, the group benefits, the short term benefits,
the long term benefits, etc..

Listing all the attributes and quality of the actions and knowing how it will unfold.


Then the justification is just about summarizing the analyze.


For example, We ask a person to choose between two different meals.

After analyze of the components of each meals the candidate chooses meal # 1.

...This doesn't sound like a real scenario doesn't it?


#### Social Pressure & Group Behavior####


Group behavior is higher than personal behavior.  

When in a group multiple different kinds of interactions happen.
From propaganda to [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink), to
[group cohesiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_cohesiveness), to the
[black sheep effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sheep), to intergroup
dynamics, etc..

One tries to be special in a group while still adhering to it.
One can loose his mind and do things he wouldn't do alone.


In this case, justification is just blaming it on the group.
When you are part of a group, you feel more powerful and loose yourself.
Your single actions is insignificant.


For example, We ask a person to choose between two different meals.

Adding to that that ten of his friends already took meal # 2 and liked it.
The person is more inclined to choose it.


#### Recurrent Hidden Thinking Aka Effect Of Child Abuse####


You are your ideologies.  

Where do our ideologies come from, how are our personalities and ideas built.
Personality is made from experiences, the stronger and sooner the experience the more
likely it is that it will morph your way of thinking and your mentality.

Child trauma marks an individual, it writes data directly into the brain.
It has been proven to be the prime determinant of adult mental health.

A video named [The Bomb in the Brain (Part 4) - The Death of Reason - The Effects of Child Abuse ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16EHfKRLfc)
by Stefan Molyneux explains how mentality builds up and affects the brain.

He refers to the "Death of Reason" which comes from amygdala damage caused by hormones produced by
fear.


> That fear-hormone-damage blocks energy from reaching the prefrontal
> cortex, where a calm person is able to reason their way out of a situation.
> There is also information here about how infants IMPRINT the hormonal
> conditions of their caretakers, and the baby-brain gets stuck there.


Thus, close-minded people are fearful people. Experiences truly impacts how
individuals react in situations. If they reach that fear state they'll skip all
the other ways and go back to their safe haven where they feel secure.
It's more powerful than anything.


Justification, in this case, is pure non-sense, it's biased and subjective.
It's just a way of finding reasons where there are none. It's just random words
to explain to others what you did and a fancy way to make yourself feel safer
about your decision.


From an evolutionary standpoint, experiences are extremely valuable. It's what
helped us adapt through all the different environmental factors. But, we
reached a point where everything changes so fast that those experiences
might not have the same importance as before. Especially the ones we had as kids
and that got anchored in the brain.


We evolved in such that the childhood experiences are 10x more important than
any experiences that you might live in the rest of your life.


That's why good parenting is the rock of society, that's why a good and healthy
environment for our child is important.


This is just the tip of the iceberg. You can watch the video I linked for deeper understanding.


For example, We ask a person to choose between two different meals.

The person instantly chooses meal # 1.

He then explains that he really likes the restaurant that prepared it, that
it tastes so great.

He never tasted meal # 2 before but was drawn towards meal # 1 because of insecurity,


--------------------------


When faced with a situation you'll dig through the 4 pools.
You might drown in one, or swim from one to another.


You *will* not even notice it.


Your brain is a network that is fed with hundreds of thousands of inputs, the conciousness
only sees 15 at a time and the rest is passed through the network for processing.


Then why not start embracing the "Instant Choice" mentality.
For some, the more they think about a problem the deeper they get lost into one
or two of the pools, most probably making sense between the objective thoughts
and the subjective ones.


Remember the next time you have to make a decision that the human mind is a fabulous construction!

Hello fellow readers,  
This is the first post of 2017, let's recap what I've been up to since
the start of the year.

> Show me how you spend your day and I'll tell you what you care about


### Newsletter & Podcast ###

![nix]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nix.png)

_Language:Unix_  

_Explanation_: The newsletter and podcast have been going really
well. I've received a lot of encouraging, positive, and constructive
feedbacks.

As of today there have been **12** issues of the newsletter and **8** new episodes
of the podcast in 2017.

Namely:

* [Unix Shells](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2047)
* [WMs and DEs](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2048)
* [Unix Ricing](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2050)
* [Special Files](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2052)
* [Unix Horror Stories](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2055)
* [Less Ties](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2051)
* [Fonts On Unix](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2065)
* [Bits and Words](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2071)

I'm particularly proud and fond of the "Less Ties" and "Fonts On Unix"
ones. The first because it got me thinking about a subject that is not
always discussed in the computing world and the second because I was
able to clarify an ambiguous topic.

So if you haven't already you can sign up to the newsletter and RSS feed
of the podcast on those links:

### EP Cycles ###

![scrot_dynep]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/dyn_ep.png)

_Language:Psychology_  

_Explanation_: My side project on [evolutionary psychology researches
correlations](http://psychology.wtf) continues. I've added two new cycles
to the list.

Here they are:


* [The Mapping Of What Triggers Aggression](http://psychology.wtf/aggresssion.php)  
    Which deals with everything I could find that is scientifically correlated with aggression.
* [The Mapping Of The Influences On Mate Choice](http://psychology.wtf/mate.php)
    Which deals with everything I could find that is scientifically correlated with mate choice.

As I keep saying and will soon publish in an article, those correlations
are patterns in human life and the mappings I'm doing are to shed light
on our nature so that we can take control of our lives and become more
accepting.

Too many are the ones that misunderstand or even dare to throw erroneous
ideas thinking they are justified by evolutionary psychology studies while
in fact they aren't. Those persons are just confirming what happens in
their own bubble.

More on this soon...

### Attention & Focus ###

![focus]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/arts/art78.jpg)

_Language:Psychology_  

_Explanation_: I sometimes stumble over a question and can't keep myself
from digging deep into it.

This time I'm interested by scientifically proven ways to increase
attention while computing.

I'm a skeptical person and not really into the "get more productive now
in 5 steps" kind of articles. But I got intrigued by this question:

> We say that blurred or tiled wallpapers help focus, but is it proven?

I've opened a brainstorm session for anyone to contribute on a
[public pad](https://titanpad.com/digital-focus-scientifically-proven-wiki)
and started [a thread](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2070)
for ampler discussion.

I've limited it to whatever is computer related, I'm not a fan of "super
food that make you focus" and even more skeptical about it.

Though I'm open and currently running anecdotal tests on myself such as:


* Monotasking, force myself to one window per workspace
* Non distracting ambient music
* Using the `at` for time management of tasks
* Added a gap at the left and right of the window to allow to view the background color, which is a shade of blue (#5686AA)
* xflux to avoid the bad effect of the blue shade at night and sleep well
* Moving text to the top of the page as I read (we read in F shape focusing on the top)
* Doing my most strenuous tasks between 9am-1pm as it's when we have the most focus

This is a truly fascinating subject.

### New Machine & Less Ties ###

![scrot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/scrots/20.png)

_Language:Unix_  

_Explanation_: I've recently switched my main work machine and during
the process I've done a research on computing with less ties.

I've compiled all my research inside a podcast episode you can find
[here](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2051).

Be sure to check the thought inducing contributions people have made on
the forums discussion.

### Books ###

![benedict](http://www.mysteriousbenedictsociety.com/images/book1.gif)

_Language:Language_  

_Explanation_: Most books you read to learn, be it direct or indirect.

Here are the ones I've recently finished or almost finished:

* [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html)
* [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com)
* [The blank slate - Steven Pinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate)
* [Lord Of The Flies - William Golding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies)
* [1984 - George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) (Yeah, I only read extracts before and not the full book)
* [The Mysterious Benedict Society - Trenton Lee Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Benedict_Society)
* [Miningness](https://meaningness.com/)

Some of those books are programming books, others are informative and
scientific, others are sci-fi, others are philosophical/logical, others
are simply fun.

### Ascii Art ###

![notebook](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.336940985.1702/sn,x1313-bg,ffffff.jpg)

_Language:ASCII_  

_Explanation_: The ascii [adventure
continues](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/asciiart.html).

Other than the usual stuffs I've recently built a mini ascii2svg converter
so that I could get high quality versions of my ascii arts.

[Here it is on Github](https://github.com/venam/ascii2svg/)

With this tool I was finally able to create products
with my ascii arts on them.  I've pushed my robot army on
[redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/venam1/collections/665202-ascii-robots?asc=u).

### Horrible Website ###

![Horrible]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/scrots/21.png)

_Language:ASCII_  

_Explanation_: We had a hackaton with the MENA devs group and during
the night I developed a "horrible website"

It was so much fun, beer, pizza, and code.

You can find the page
[here](https://rawgit.com/venam/mena_devs_night_horrible_website/master/index.html)
and the code
[here](https://github.com/venam/mena_devs_night_horrible_website). It's
simply an mashup of multiple horrible things.

### Patreon ###

![patreon]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/patreon.png)

_Language:Value_  

_Explanation_: I've wondered for a long time if people would pay for the
things I value and give away. For that reason I've created a [patreon
page](https://patreon.com/venam).

If this thing works out, it would be a sort of passive income which
would allow me to push more of the stuffs I already do.

The drawback is that, unlike what I expected, the fee of transfer
is higher. It amounts to ~$16 per transaction with payoneer as the
gateway. But it's not that much of an issue as long as I transfer once
every few months.

It's still something great that I'm looking forward to.

Thanks again to the people who support me, be it monetary or not.

### Nixers ###

![nixers]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/forums.png)

_Language:Community_  

_Explanation_: The nixers community is going well.

We might have a lower post count and activities on the forums but the
ones we have are excellent.

These days I'm trying to bring suprising topics that everyone can
tackle. I want  to make it more vibrant. This has arguable effects...

On a side note, I still don't have access to the domain name and I am
waiting for it to expire so that I can transfer it.

This poses certain issues such as the newsletter emails considered as
spam by some providers. I hope to fix that as soon as we get the domain.

We would also be able to open a mail service.

On the topic of communities, I keep wondering about the balance between
the number of dreamers and acters, when some are thrilled by changes
and others aren't, etc..

These are a couple of links that have helped me clear my mind:

* [Geeks, Mops, and Sociopaths](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths)
* [Group Work](https://venam.nixers.net/blog/programming/2015/09/25/group-work.html)
* [Intentional Communities](https://aeon.co/essays/like-start-ups-most-intentional-communities-fail-why)
* [Product Life Cycle Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_life-cycle_management_%28marketing%29)
* [Isaiah's job](https://mises.org/library/isaiahs-job)

### Now ###

I'm happy with the direction my life is taking, I'll keep going on the
same track, iterating, polishing, incrementing.

However I remain open for changes.

Spring is coming and life is springing from everywhere.

Today I started cleaning up the garden, I'll soon plant stuffs like
last year.

As usual...  
If you want something done, no one’s gonna do it for you, use your
own hands.

And let’s go for a beer together sometime, or just chill.

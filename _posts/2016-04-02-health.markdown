The body is a temporal window into the world.  

Stain it and you will obstruct the view. Stick a colorful wallpaper on it and
you will be drifted away from reality.


Clean windows leading to great views are relaxing and light.


One day, my best friend, a medical student, gave me this definition:

> Health is the ability to face and react.


With lack of preparation and anticipation you will fail to face anything.


This article is a summary of how I interact with health.  

PS: The views I'm presenting aren't fixed, I stay open to different opinions.

### Physical Education ###


Your body is a sculpture left by your ancestors. Through *successful*
descendants you have been born. You are part of a generation of winners who
survived.


You wouldn't be here otherwise.


The body has immense potential but [many flaws](http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/top-10-design-flaws-in-the-human-body).

With training it can adapt to defend itself, from the outside and inside.


For men, keeping a fit body by practicing physical activities is a way to build
agility, strength, and the brain for reactivity and speed.

For women, keeping a fit body means being flexible and strong enough to
rear children, give birth, and take care of them. It also keeps their visual
perception keen to rapidly notice changes in their surrounding.
Adding to that the ability to flee with her beloved in risky situations.

In a hunter-gatherer society those would have meant the difference between life
and death.

That's why women are better at climbing trees and at managing the house
while men are better at dealing with the outside world and bringing resources.


Artificial imitations of those criteria have emerged. Men have fake muscles
without flexibility and women hide themselves under their sexual attractiveness.


The body is not only a tool for achieving tasks it's also the container of yourself.

Having a sane body is relaxing for the mind.

[Mens sana in corpore sano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_sana_in_corpore_sano).

Keep your body strong and ready.


![Hygiene]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_hygiene.jpg)


### Hygiene ###


There is absolutely nothing on earth that humans cannot win against except
bacterias and viruses.

We've grown an internal self-learning army to fight against them.

Like all armies if it's not trained and equipped it will fail and capitulation
will follow.

There's a fauna on the flora that is our body.  
We've been killing this fauna by over sanitizing. We've been calling dirt the
training ground protecting us from our only invaders.

Blame it on the media.

Telling us how infected the food we eat is and how many times we should
wash ourselves. Shaming people's body odors by marketing perfumes and even
anti-perspiration surgeries.

Don't get me wrong, personal hygiene is fine as long as you let the body in its
harmony.  
Food has never been healthier and soap was one of the invention that changed
mankind.



![Supplements]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_supplements.jpg)

### Supplements? ###


Is food the only valid source of nutriments for the body, can't we boost
ourselves through other means?

Like we've conquered our environment we'd like to conquer our body.

Everyone wants the magic formula to live longer, stay more focused, be more
productive.

If there's a lesson we have learned throughout the fights with nature it's that
fighting leads to complications. Instead of going against it we should embrace
symbiosis and shape the fragile cycle to our advantage without breaking it.

Promises of gratifications without efforts, laziness makes people cling to
little hopes.

On TV they advertise snake oil pills with extravagant effects but why
would you rely on those when you don't have to.

There are scientific studies on the effect of certain chemicals on the long run.  
Whether the effects are positive, whether their are cost efficient, whether the
natural way is more convenient.

The blogger Gwern is working on [an article](http://www.gwern.net/Longevity) on
longevity, experimenting and researching different methods of interventions
that could possibly help extend life span.


Let's note that when a doctor prescribes supplements or medications it's a
different story. Doctors know your body more than you do, it's their life mission,
let them do their job.

![Tattoos]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_tatoo.jpg)

### Tattoos ###


Yes, tattoos have been a tradition in some cultures for thousands of years,
and so was slavery.


We aren't going back in time.


They've lost their meanings and are now synonyms with submission.

People wear the tags of capitalism, showing how they've fallen to the new
world scam - the one that messes up your mind into thinking there's a form of
individuality and personality in displaying materialist things to your
peers.

Whenever I see a tattoo this sentence runs in my head:  
"Look I've fallen prey!"

![Nature]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_nature.jpg)

### Nature ###


As mentioned earlier we should embrace nature's equilibrium.


We debate on and on about the impact humans have on nature, if we're disrupting
it and if it has non-reversible effects.

The masses intensively seeks end-of-the-world scenarios, dreaming of
cataclysms that could one day happen... And others listen to them.


The facts are there, think on your own.

The reserves of fossil fuels, which are residues of lifeforms - lifeforms which
are composed of carbons - will be depleted in the next few hundred years if we
continue to consume them as we do today.

We will have to switch to other viable sources of energy.

Nuclear energy seems like a good option on the consumption aspect but due to
the risk factor people are reluctant to adopt it. The risks aren't from the
nuclear plants but from others, for instance an angry group of persons
attacking a plant or using that technology for destruction.

A nice thing about nature is that is has an auto-cleaning process, the fossil
fuels will refill themselves with time.

For it to happen the cycle of life, carbon based entities, needs to go around.

CO2 in the atmosphere helps plants grow and life in the ocean floor proliferate,
which wouldn't happen with dormant volcanoes.

The earth was getting colder before the industrial revolution of the 19th century.

Climate change is happening but it's not as bad is it sounds.

On another hand, our emissions are fast, dangerous, and not regulated.
We're not dealing with the issue correctly, poisoning ourselves in the process
by infecting humans.

We're part of the cycle, and without knowing it we're cleaning our own mess.

We're killing ourselves - The earth equilibrium is killing us.  
The end of the world is not the end of the planet, it's our end.


![Food]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_food1.jpg)

### Food ###


There are divergent opinions on GMOs. For years they were thought to be
"monsters of nature", and some still perceive them as such.

DNA is agnostic, the same DNA components are in all living matters, only the
ordering and number of genes differ.

GMOs are selected through accelerated artificial selection.

We've been doing that for years with crops, sheep, dogs, cats, flowers,
and all sorts of living things.

We can now remove the negative effects of some vegetables and make them more
resistant.

This implies using less water and less fertilizers for the crops. The cost of
production goes down, the prices go down, it enables poor families to eat,
and we pollute less in the process.

There are no proof the GMO vegetables are more cancerous than normal vegetables,
if something was proven it's the opposite.


You should be aware of all the things you put in your mouth (and also what comes out).


I've been practicing vegetarianism for the past 6 or 7 years.


Being vegetarian makes you realize the connection we have with food.


We are what we eat.


On the vegetarian journey you won't find many that agree with your
beliefs. You'll have to spend time cooking and creating your own recipes.  
You'll enjoy every ingredients you add. You'll find mesmerizing the food
quest: To what extent you will have to go to get a meal.  
You'll realize what food is helping your body - You'll listen to what your
body really needs.


You'll savor the "raw" taste.


Cooking will become an intimate moment.

I started working on my small dream: Building a garden and being able
to eat homegrown vegetables.

There's also my [cooking section](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/food.html).


![Children]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_children.jpg)

### Children ###


Children are fragile beings.


Their are thrown in a wild world and the parents are their only protection.


Consequently mankind developed something surprising: When people live close together
in the same environment for a long period they will start to share similar health
defense mechanisms; and what closer than a child and its parents.

The parents transmit their defense systems to their infants.

This is stronger when done through breast feeding. It also has the bonus of
helping brain growth and empathy, two useful skills to face the world.


It's a once in a lifetime gift.


Parents have the leisure of choosing to build a bright child or not. They are
in full control. Those decisions not only impact the child but society too.


![Sex]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_sex.jpg)

### Sex ###


We are a sexual specie and it is beautiful.

Males and females have two sets of hormones on two ends of the spectrum.

Those hormones drive our everyday behaviors and we don't have to be ashamed of it.

Men like to compete, to seduce females, to build coalitions, and repel enemies.

Women are more social oriented, they care about relationships, building networks
of goods, making sure their children have a future to look to, having a
safe and resourceful place to live in.

From seduction, to bounding, to copulation, to children rearing, sex is the motor
of life.


Sex talks are still taboo talks, you can't bring the topic in most conversations.

However because it's inherently present in us and we have to repress our urges
it has given rise to horrible problems: circumcision, female mutilation,
overuse of pornography which leads to mental scars and erectile dis-functions,
the sexualization of females in media, couple dissatisfaction turning into
break-ups and divorce, etc..


Religion is a big cause of this. Using oppression and trauma, it has frighten
generations to not talk openly.

Today it's different.


There shouldn't be shyness to talk about sex topics when it is necessary.  
Sex is the glue of couples, it's what creates life.


The intercourse itself plays an important role in relationship intimacy.  
It's a pleasure to share when the woman feels secure enough to open herself.


On the physical side it has very positive effects, it relaxes, it gives a sense
of security, it diminishes the risk of prostate cancer, while having sex women
have a high level of estrogen which makes their hair and skin shine, it
strengthen the muscles, it sharpens your senses, it drops cholesterol level,
it's beneficial for the heart by lowering the blood pressure, it increases
sleep quality, it helps the immune system, and more.


But the most important: You become one with your partner.

![Doctors]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_doctor.jpg)

### Doctors ###


Doctors aren't wizards that know everything.


They sure know a lot but you can't expect them to suddenly find what's wrong
with your body if you don't cooperate.

When visiting a doctor be sure to mention as many details as possible and don't
miss any.


Doctors are there for a reason.


![Mental]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/health_mental.jpg)


### Mental ###


I won't develop this section, I'm just mentioning ideas.

Train your mind and memory, be curious, and don't fall for brainwash.

Seek the truth.

And when you need to talk be sure to have people around you can talk to.

Hello fellow readers,  

The last two months I've been extremely interested by evolutionary programming
and group dynamics. In this post I'll try to gather some of the important factors
I've noticed repeating themselves across the multiple opinions and examples, and
the ones that just seemed noticeably important.


Naming those factors helps uncover the camouflage around life in its purest
form, of what it means to be alive. What it means to have a sustainable being,
one that changes across time to morph with its surrounding.  

Once we finally understand them we might move unto more complex territories
such as the initial conditions on earth, the particularity or singularity that
incubated the start of life. Then, with those in hands, the field of AI will
flourish and grow!


Scientists already tried their luck at reproducing the early state with
arguable luck. However, it is still practically impossible to guess if what is
tested in the labs is relevant or not.
You can do your own online search about those experiments, for example [this](http://www.wired.com/2009/05/ribonucleotides/) one.
They are also doing amazing researches in the [evolutionary biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology) field.


In no particular order of appreciation, the next few points are what I think
the rock pillows of evolution.

### Randomness, Mutations, & Crossovers ###



Randomness is beautiful, but the die of nature is unbalanced.

What we think is uniformly random is not at all. The law governing randomness
is heavily dependent on historic and environmental factors. It doesn't mean
that all events are pre-calculated but that the chances of hitting a number
varies constantly. It would be similar to playing poker and suddenly finding
that the size of the deck has changed because new cards and new rules were added.

This is how the randomness of nature is, far from the strict laws, closer to a
law that moves like the tide.
It's unlikely that humans will ever be able to grasp all the elements that
create the law that governs it.


A mutation is an alteration or change of form, quality, attribute, functions
of any trait in an individual. The change can be apparent or not. A mutation
is only considered transmittable in evolution if it has affected the genotype of
the being. The genotype contains the genetic code of the being,
`the combination of alleles on homologous chromosomes`. This is the only change
that can be transmitted from one generation to another. It's the code making up
what the being is.

Let's note that the mutation on the genotype level that is transmitted should take place in
the gonads (germinal cells). If the change doesn't happen there, it might be
expressed in the phenotype but not transmitted to the descendant.


The mutation happens randomly on the current law of distribution of nature at
that time for the specific group of beings.


A genetic crossover is the genotype resulting from the mix-up of the two
genotypes of the parents. The probability of one attribute of the parent taking
over the attribute of the other parent follows the randomness we talked about
and that we'll discuss more later on.

For the technical aspects of the crossover refer to the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover) on chromosomal crossover and the [crossover genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)) page.



### Robustness Against Small Changes ###

An adaptable and resistant being is one that can survive and continue its usual
activities while under small changes inside its body and environment.
For example, a human is still able to continue a fairly normal life if it suffers
the loss of one of its member, a finger for instance. The other parts of the
body will equilibrate and make up for the loss.
Same for the environment, for the individual to evolve correctly it
should be able to adapt to the loss of one of the essential attribute in its
surrounding.

The robustness is relatively dependent on the speed for readjustment.
It is similar to [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing),
inspired by the [metallurgy technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)).
In common words, a system gets more robust if it has the time to find out
about its deficiencies and recalibrate itself accordingly. My best friend, Francois Boulos, a
medical student, told me a metaphor that is a perfect illustration of this phenomena.
Imagine a car hitting a wall at full speed, it'll crash, explode, and the passengers
won't have any chance of survival. Now imagine the same scenario but the car
approaching extremely slowly. Once the passengers notice the deformation on the
front bumper they consolidate it with metal and other materials. They repeat the
consolidation until there's no more danger.


For further understanding of this topic there's a [superb paper](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/robust-systems.pdf) on building robust systems by Gerald Jay Sussman.


![crash](http://pub.iotek.org/p/5ux28ux.png)


There exist a mechanism to instantly correct the mutations happening to the
cells. Only a minimal part of those mutation will stick and be transmitted.
Moreover, in most cases the mutation are not expressed in the phenotype. For instance, in
the human genome there is a whole section of the DNA that does not code for
any specific behavior, at least we do not know its purpose. Being parts that don't affect
the phenotype there is a higher chance of a mutation happening on there. Its surface
is larger than the one which codes for something.

We can consider it as a protector for the rest of the DNA reducing the
factor of mutations sent to the descendant. Slowing down the cooling.



### Pool Of Solutions ###

Robustness is also achievable at a genotype level.
With Respect to the current distribution law, multiple variants of the genotype
should be able to produce similar functional phenotypes that solve the same problem, which we refer to as
a pool of solutions. Small changes in the genotype might
make a huge differences in the overall fitness but big changes might give similar results.

This means that the fitness of the phenotype is dependent on the combination of genes rather
than the genes themselves.



A [recent article](http://nautil.us/issue/20/creativity/the-strange-inevitability-of-evolution)
of the nautilus magazine developed on this subject.



### A Gene Circuit ###

As we said in the last paragraph, the combination of genes let us have more
than one option to a valid/stronger path in evolution.
This is the consequence of having the genes work together inside a network.
The phenotype is but a general property of the current state of the circuit.

The related [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_regulatory_circuit) is scarce.
The studies around this field are still relatively dark, it's an undiscovered
lands full of opportunities.

The only persons who dare to touch it are biological engineers which use this
property to try to reproduce computer-like system from biological system.
It's called a [biological circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biological_circuit), and
is part of the [synthetic biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology) field.



### Natural Selection ###

Only the chosen ones have priorities in the survival game. Their phenotypes
being superior affects the probability of their genotype surviving for another
generation.

That is because we follow the Darwinian view of evolution (until proven wrong) which says that a
property is kept if it augments the chance of reproduction and survival unlike
the Lamarckian view, that `inheritance is an acquired characteristics`, "use
'em or lose 'em".

Consequently, a fitter individual from a population survives only if it has more
chances of mating. The traits that influence this are the robustness against
the current way of living and robustness against near future ways of living for that specie.
This greatly depends on the environment and conditions at the time.

Let's say, for example, that a certain animal has white fur. Someday one of
the male grows black fur and coincidently, from a mutation, turns out to be
a bit stronger.
He is lucky and mate with multiple females. This might give rise to a new generation
where females are more attracted to black fur and males with black fur are more
resistant. This illustrate how an unrelated phenotype can have a direct relation
with the genotype.
The genotype cannot be seen by others so it's highly dependent on the phenotype.


To reproduce the ranking system in the world of algorithm multiple methods are
available.


* Roulette wheel Selection

Every individual is assigned a fitness (according to factors well chosen) then
placed in the overall population having a weight equivalent to its fitness, like
on a pie chart. A number between 1 and the sum of all fitness is chosen and we
let the arrow spins around.

* Tournament

Select two random individuals from a group and take the best between them. Repeat
until the best individuals pool is filled. (nb: it doesn't matter if the same
individual is present twice in the pool)


We'll discuss more complicated ways of selection in the next sections.

### The Importance Of Groups ###

A population is composed of multiple entities, it's a flock.
Analysing a single person's movements apart from the whole group blinds us on
what the global changes are.

A specie might have sub-groups that are scattered at different geographical
positions (this can be due to any effect) and start diverging greatly.

The internal behavior inside the sub-groups might be different. Norms might have
been set for the survival of the specie.

Inside a group, if it is evolved enough to have norms and institutions, the
black sheep effect might take place and the mutation (change/difference) factor
goes on a decline. Which means that the robustness speed is slowed down (which
is more adequate, see the above metaphor).

Once the group reaches another level of norms, social behaviors are instituted
and the ranking system might resemble more an [Eigen Morality](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1820&re=1)
political system than the simple tournament.


You can find two example of algorithms implementing group behaviors in the
`cleveralgorithm` book, [cultural algorithm](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/physical/cultural_algorithm.html) and [memetic algorithm](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/physical/memetic_algorithm.html).


One thing to keep from this paragraph is that the global meta-mind of the
group is more powerful than a single individual behavior and that a group big
enough can live alone and diverge from the main branch of its specie.



### Interspecies Survival ###

No one survives alone, the world is made of multiple beings all sharing the
same cozy place.
You can replace the word environment in all the other paragraphs by [symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis)
or [system biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology) (depending on the scale you want to look at).

Be it beneficial or not, any interactions from one specie to another creates a
snowball effect.
Food chains, infections, viruses, relationships, climate change, etc.. It goes
on and on.


A very simple implementation of interspecies interaction is the [Bask Sneppen model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak–Sneppen_model for interspecies interaction).

>The model dynamics repeatedly eliminates the least adapted species and mutates it and its neighbors to recreate the interaction between species.



### Conclusion ###

The law of distribution of the randomness of nature is the sum of all the
factors mentioned along this article.
We're still far from discovering the true meanings of evolution and life.
People are still arguing if we should take a top-down approach or down-top
one. I'm not sure which I've taken here but I'm glad I did settle on it!


On my journey through evolutionary programming I didn't find yet anything that
joined the multiple views I mentioned. It's probably due to the complexity of
having everything affecting everything creating a cycle, the cycle of
evolution and life.


If you want an interesting book to read which goes in depth about the subject
of life I recommend: [What is life? How chemistry becomes biology](http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2013/05/what-life-chemistry-biology-addy-pross).

I might be wrong on a lot of points but writing this was a lot of fun and I
hope it'll be as fun to read it!


Thanks a lot to my best buddy Francois Boulos for the proof reading and new ideas.
You're going to be a great doctor (°∀°)b

Hello fellow readers,
In this post I’ll list some of the projects and experiments I’m working on or
just finished.

My [last projects update](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/programming/2016/02/28/february-projects.html) was in February.


### 4.3XP###

![4-3XP]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/4-3XP.png)

_Language:Human_ 

_Explanation_: Check under the post title, there's a surprise.

This is the 4-3XP (pronounced the "A" Experiment - 1337 mode activated).

It's simply a narration of my posts.  
So look around maybe the posts you didn't read yet might have their audio version
available and you'll be able to listen to them instead of reading.

Everytime you see the 4-3XP you can listen to the audio version.

There's also the [soundcloud channel](https://soundcloud.com/4-3xp/).


### Meditation###


![Sammy]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/waking_up.jpg)

_Language: Mind_

_Explanation_: I've started daily meditation: A simple 5 minutes session.  
I'm using a beginner technique that Sam Harris discusses [here](https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/how-to-meditate).

To paraphrase, it's about removing the non-stop narration usually happening
in your head.  
Redirecting the third eye unto your body and environment, not on thoughts.

Aside from relaxation and focus, meditation is a way to reflect one self place
in the world.  
What are we?


### Data mining projects###


![Elast]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/elast.png)

_Language: Multiple_

_Explanation_: I'm building a huge bank of data.  
The new project goal is to incorporate the info in a fast search engine.

In the process, I'm switching from postgresql to elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch has many issues.

It is galling to install... And I do not dare to mention upgrades and the
non-backward compatibility.

Sometimes it randomly hangs or tells you that it ran out of memory when
it's actually not. Restarting the daemon fixes it.  

When it works it's cool.

You interact with it is through a REST api.  

The best, and maybe only, feature of elasticsearch is that it's easy to create
a full text search engine that goes through any property of the data.  

It does it by default and that's what I need.


### One Word a day###


![Minim]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mini.jpg)

_Language: English_

_Explanation_: Learning a new word everyday, it's a fun idea I've taken from a
[theminimalist](http://www.theminimalists.com/) podcast episode.

I have difficulties expressing myself. It's hard for me to find the best
combination of words to transfer my ideas.

I want to get better and this project is a good way to do so.

I might forget a lot of the words that happened to be in this project but I'm
training my mind into going out of it's way to focus on them.


### Shadi###


![shadi]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/shadi.gif)

_Language:shell_ 

_Explanation_: This is a project inspired by [dbag](https://github.com/iotek/dbag/),
an aglomeration of irc quotes of one of the nixers member.

It has also been inspired by a [forums post](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1872)
by pranomostro where he pipes all the nixers intro into a markov chain to
generate new introduction posts.

The shadi knowledge generator regroups the two ideas, it takes quotes from
shadi and generate sentences he could have said.

> many ways this can be done in 2 weeks read it somewhere.

See it [here](https://github.com/venam/shadi).


### Mapping The Unmapped###


![Hidden]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/history.jpg)

_Language:Progress_ 

_Explanation_: There are many places in my region that aren't shown on Google
maps.

I took the matter in my own hands, made a trip around the popular places and
historical sites, took pictures, and mapped them.

I'm now a "local guide" according to Google map.

This is a good initiative!

I'll keep this going and encourages anyone to do so.

Someone mentioned a game called Ingress, that turns this into an adventure.
I haven't tried it yet so I can't give my verdict on it.


### Fake/MENA Presentation###


![Fake?]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mena.png)

_Language:JS/HTML_ 

_Explanation_: I'm part of a group called the MENA developers.
The last weeks I kept bringing the idea of organizing talks.

A few days later it was on!

AltCity, be the host of the event.

I prepared a presentation called "A 'fake' project".
However, one hour before the venue the host, which normally only give
entrepreneurial events, asked to review the presentation slides.

They didn't agree to "sponsor" the sort of talk I wanted to give and cancelled
my presentation, with the presumption that it give them a bad reputation.

I raged for a while and came up with a new presentation in the minimal
amount of time I had left.

I presented one of my blog post about [what computing and programming represents](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/programming/2015/11/04/what-is-programming.html).


### Driving in LB###


![ba bad driving]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/driving.png)

_Language:JS/HTML_ 

_Explanation_: In my last post I mentioned  "A Message I want To Transmit" and
it was this project.

You can find it [here](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/psychology/2016/03/13/driving.html).

I'm satisfied with it, it was well done.

I even wrote a library for simulating driving using [d3js](https://d3js.org/) and made
animations for every annoying road behavior the Lebanese have.

I hope that I have released the tension of the people who have been thinking
the same for years.

Laughters are bonus points.


### Arts###


![Arts](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/arts/art65.jpg)

_Language: Left Brain_

_Explanation_: My girlfriend has a better phone camera than mine.

She insisted on re-taking the photos of my arts section.

You can now enjoy them in high quality.

[Check the page out](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/arts.html)


### Ascii Arts###


![chrono](http://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/ascii/as16.png)

_Language:ASCII char set+TTY escape codes_ 

_Explanation_: Since my last post I really got into the Ascii art movement.

I'm slowly getting better at building my robots army.

Brace yourself, soon I'll be able to conquer the universe.

Xero mentioned a BBS and an ascii art group called [Impure](http://bbs.ninja/pack/impure60/).

I got curious, joined their IRC and had a chat with the people who have been
doing ascii arts since they started to be called ascii arts.

Hellbeard, the administrator of the group, liked my work and invited me to be
part of their next release: Impure61.

Ironically, I had never heard of the ascii art scene just a week before.
Now I'm part of Impure!ascii.

It's very cool!


### Nixers Podcast###


![nix bad driving]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nix.png)

_Language:PHP/Postgres_ 

_Explanation_: My [podcast project](http://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1656)
for nixers is going well.

I Built an interface to manage everyone's schedule.

Sometimes no one joins which at first was awkward, I'm starting to get the
hang of it.

I hope it's an enjoyable learning experience for the listeners.

I also extend every episode in forums threads so that people can comment on
them afterwards.

We're also having an [introduction song contest](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1906)
instead of having to come up with different intro at the beginning of the episode.


### EP Notes UI###


![evol]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ep_.png)

_Language:PHP/Postgres/reactjs_ 

_Explanation_: The quest of dynamic evolutionary psychology continues.

I designed an interface to browse the data available.

I built everything using [reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/), PHP, and
postgresql.

We're now in the process of linking them, finding the cycles, and preparing
a youtube channel.

In the future we might even write a book.

If you have experience with video editing or hand drawn video explanation
contact me.

I want this to be a society changing project.


### Light colorscheme###


![light theme](http://i.imgur.com/z99KfA0.png)

_Language:Xresources_

_Explanation_: We had a [light colorscheme contest](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1853)
at nixers.

It was a phenomenal way to learn about new color theory.

Tired of the ol' white on black.

I didn't win but I sure learned.

The theme can be found on my GH: [here](https://github.com/venam/Light-theme)


### Wargames###


![wechall]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/wechall.png)

_Language:brain_ 

_Explanation_: I still play wargames in my spare time.
Not as much as before but I still love it.

This week I introduced [my own](https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1909)
"Internet Scavenger Hunt" on nixers.net using
ideas I took from those wargames.

It's not a big complicated one.

It touches encryption and steganography.


### Xhost###


![xhost]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/xhost.png)

_Language: PHP_

_Explanation_: This is a lost project.

I built it, and burned it.

The idea was to create an upload page that returns direct download links and
would always rotate through multiple hosts in the backend.


### URNN###


![xhost]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/urnn_.png)

_Language: C/Perl/Shell scripts_

_Explanation_: URNN is still alive!

Neeasade is contributing, he made an easy wrapper script and is adding
C versions of the scripts in a new branch instead of the Perl.

We're in the process of solving the issue with images that don't have 10 colors.


### Garden###

![garden]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/garden/8.jpg)

I couldn't photograph everything.

_Language:Nature_

_Explanation_: I'm gardening!

I planted vegetables and we have fruits.


This projects I've always wanted to do.
I'll start small and little by little I'll make bigger plots.


### June Nixers Projects###


![zip it](http://podcast.nixers.net/zipper.gif)

_Language: Fun_

_Explanation_: I'm shaking up the nixers community in june by introducing
multiple projects:

Here's the list:

* Internet scavenger hunt
* Intro/outro podcast song contest
* A week in the TTY
* Ascii Art Contest
* Webcasts threads

Be sure to check the forums for update.


### Cleaning Beaches###


![ugly indian](http://www.theuglyindian.com/images/header.gif)

_Language:Kindness_ 

_Explanation_: This is my weekend project.

When my girlfriend and I went to the beach we appalled and shocked
because of the garbage around.

Thus, in the same fashion as the [the ugly indian](http://www.theuglyindian.com/menu.html)
we're gonna do it ourselves.

So I did this for my local community out of good will.

We went to a beach with the goal of removing all plastic bottles and garbage.

At first we brought 4 huge bags but after 30 min they were filled.
We went to a supermarket near to buy gloves and new degradable plastic bag.

When the sun went out, we had filled 9 huge bags: 4 for recycling and 5 or pure garbage.

They were heavy but it was fulfilling to throw them in the recycling and garbage
dumps.

The plastic bottle caps, which we also filtered from the pile of rubbish, are
going to go to an association for handicapped persons.

Some asked us "are you with some organisation", and we replied "Nope, we're just humans".

They retorted with "God bless you" or "May God make you strong", and I kept myself
from replying "I'm not a believer, you should take the matter in your own damn
hands not wait for a God".

I was too focused on what I was doing to reply.


Shame on us, we couldn't finish completely before there was no light anymore,
we were also extremely tired.

Let's hope the [broken window theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)
will work and keep people from throwing stuffs.

Another good initiative!


# Conclusion#

Yep, I've grown, and I'm happy of where I'm going.

These days I want to contribute to the community around me.  
If you want something done, no one's gonna do it for you, use your own hands.
